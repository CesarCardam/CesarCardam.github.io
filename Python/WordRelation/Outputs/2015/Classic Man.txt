72. Jidenna Featuring Roman GianArthuralbum
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the only nigga doin' it
You other niggas ruined it
I'm too legit, go Hammer wit' the foolishness
My nana said my grandma can maneuver this industry
Until I'm stupid rich and now I'm stupid rich, ah
Even if she go away, even if she go away
Assumin' this is what they humor is
To Pimp a Butterfly my newest shit
Effective rumor is the way I proven it
[Hook: Jidenna]
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G, I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man
[Verse 2: Jidenna]
I burn through the hood like, "Whoa"
When everybody's feeling so cold
I cool like Nat King Cole and niggas get a bit of my glow
I got charm like a leprechaun, mamafucker
Now y'all fucking with the wrong mamafucker
Treat me like a don, mamafucker
And we don't live by the law, mamafucker
[Pre-Hook: Jidenna]
Even if she go away, even if she go away
Even if she go away, even if she go away
[Hook: Jidenna]
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G, I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
(Classic man) That's on my mama though
I got piranha flow, fuckin' up your designer clothes
(Casket man) Where be your rapper's angle?
Bunch of subliminal bitches, I'd rather fingerbang 'em
Oh, ke-mo sah-bee, pray to God nobody try me
Catch a body over nothin', Top couldn't even stop me
I got key to my city, I got key to California
I might legalize your homicide and mourn marijuana
Let my daddy smoke his weed, only thing they keep on Philly
I ain't got no jewelry on me, bitch, I got the jewelry in me
Oh, shit, let me talk my shit, I always been the shit
This ain't overnight, they love me now like they loved me then
I know what I like, I eat the pussy for my nourishment
I know how to cherish it
I know how to decorate your wall and further furnish it
I'm a burn your shit down, this is what the furnace is
I'm a turn your shit around wit' some friendly services
Ain't no nervousness like I'm ratchet or conservative
And that's affirmative
All I do is lay-up and face up my big bills
And paste up, got no chill for fake ones, like, for real, they say...
[Hook: Jidenna]
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G, I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man
[Verse 3: Jidenna
Keep my gloves dirty but my hands clean
Got to keep the business in the family
Bread when I'm fillin' up the pantry
Now my niggas slang 'caine like a dandy
I tell you how it go
You pull out rubber bands, I pull out an envelope
The ladies on my elbow ain't for the show
Every madam on my team is a top general, oh
Got to be ready for war (War)
Should they get into my door? (Door)
Get 'em, we'll get 'em, I know that we'll get 'em
Cause I lived through this shit before, oh
[Hook: Jidenna]
I'm a classic man
You can be mean when you look this clean, I'm a classic man
Callin' on me like a young O.G, I'm a classic man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old-fashioned man
Yeah, baby, I'm a classic man
[Outro]
(I'm a classic man) Even if she go away, even if she go away
(I'm a classic man) Even if she go away, even if she go away
I'm a classic man, old-fashioned man
