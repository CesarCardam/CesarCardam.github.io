44. Fetty Wap Featuring MontyFetty Wap
Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off I'mma start by saying this, ay
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ay
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ay
Ba-baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?
