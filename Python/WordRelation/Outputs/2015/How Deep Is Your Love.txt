100. Calvin Harris & Disciplesalbum
I want you to breathe me
Let me be your air
Let me roam your body freely
No inhibition, no fear
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
What devotion? Are you?
How deep is your love?
Is it like nirvana?
Hit me harder, again
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
Is it like the ocean?
Pull me closer, again
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
