74. Meghan TrainorTitle
Dear future husband
Here's a few things
You'll need to know if you wanna be
My one and only all my life
Take me on a date
I deserve a break
And don't forget the flowers every anniversary
'Cause if you'll treat me right
I'll be the perfect wife
Buying groceries
Buy-buying what you need
You got that 9 to 5
But, baby, so do I
So don't be thinking I'll be home and baking apple pies
I never learned to cook
But I can write a hook
Sing along with me
Sing-sing along with me (Hey)
You gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Even when I'm acting crazy
Tell me everything's alright
