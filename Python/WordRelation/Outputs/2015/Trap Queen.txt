[Intro]
I'm like "hey, what's up, hello"
Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in that door
I just wanna chill, got a sack for us to roll
Married to the money, introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixin' for low
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
Got 56 a gram, prob' a 100 grams though
Man, I swear I love her how she work the damn pole
Hit the strip club, we be letting bands go
Everybody hating, we just call them fans though
In love with the money, I ain't never letting go
[Chorus]
Every time the chilget hundreds
I hear Sim, the ladies in my hands
I wrote this songers the get into
Oh, oh, oh
Yet the drums they swing roll
A trumpet steakone
A trumpet steakone
A trumpet steakone
[Verse 1]
If we that are kiss
Mommy and the Katy Perry song
If we that are kiss
Mommy and the Kanye West song
If we that are kiss
Trumpets that the turning me on
If we that are kiss
Mommy and the Katy Perry song
[Chorus]
Every time the chilget hundreds
I hear Sim, the ladies in my hands
I wrote this songers the get into
Oh, oh, oh
Yet the drums they swing roll
A trumpet steakone
A trumpet steakone
A trumpet steakone
[Verse 2]
If we that are kiss
Peachels and the Kanye West song
If we that are kiss
Mommy and the rumbling song
If we that are kiss
Trumpets that the turning me on
If we that are kiss
Mommy and the Katy Perry song
