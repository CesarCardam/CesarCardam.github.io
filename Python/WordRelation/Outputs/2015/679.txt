21. Fetty Wap Featuring Remy BoyzFetty Wap
Baby girl, you're so damn fine though
I'm tryna know if I could hit it from behind though
I'm sipping on you like some fine wine though
And when it's over, I press rewind though
You talking bands, girl, I got it
Benjamins all in my pocket
I traded in my Trues for some Robins
He playing Batman, Fetty's gon rob him
I got a Glock in my 'rari, 17 shots, no .38
I got a Glock in my 'rari, 17 shots, no .38
I'm like, yeah, she's fine
Wonder when she'll be mine
She walk past, I press rewind
To see that ass one more time
And I got this sewed up
Remy Boyz, they know us
All fast money, no slow bucks
No one can control us
Ay, yeaaah baby
