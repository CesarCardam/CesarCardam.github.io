33. Justin BieberPurpose
What do you mean, ooh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean, hey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean
Oh, what do you mean
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean
Oh oh oh what do you mean
Better make up your mind
What do you mean
You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy, or complaining
