41. Natalie La Rose Featuring Jeremihalbum
Come on
Natalie la Rose
I wanna rock with somebody (woah yeah)
I wanna take shot with somebody (shot, shot, shot, shot)
I wanna leave with somebody (somebody, c'mon, c'mon)
And we ain't gonna tell nobody
We ain't gonna tell nobody
Walking everybody knows what's good
But some gonna hate what's new
We just do our favorite time to waste
Always playing cool
And at the end of the night
When our love's going out we turn down
Oh no we won't (we'll never turn it down, we'll never turn it down)
And when it try to make this leave we turn to say we never going home
And you know just what I wanna do
I wanna rock with somebody (woah yeah)
I wanna take shot with somebody (shot, shot, shot, shot)
I wanna leave with somebody (somebody, c'mon, c'mon)
And we ain't gonna tell nobody
We ain't gonna tell nobody
Walking everybody know what's good
We are only block
Bring us everything we think we need
Tonight is going up (tonight is going up)
And at the end of the night
When our love's going out we turn down
Oh no we won't (we'll never turn it down, we'll never turn it down)
And when it try to make this leave we turn to say we never going home
I wanna rock with somebody (woah yeah)
I wanna take shot with somebody (shot, shot, shot, shot)
I wanna leave with somebody (somebody, c'mon, c'mon)
And we ain't gonna tell nobody
