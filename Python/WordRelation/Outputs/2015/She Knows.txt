Yeah, uh-huh!

In case you didn't know, Juicy got figgas
I keep me two chicks like my homie Jack Tripper
I shoot in they face like that boy Reggie Miller
And I kill that pussy like my name Jack the Ripper
Baby, I'm horny and I ain't too proud to beg
Instead show me the bed
Early morning breakfast and head
And I got Tina, Tasha and Toya, I call 'em the triple threat
All the stars they be soaking when this the first night them freaks met
You know, from the moment she turned around
She know, how to back it up and drop it down
She know, she what all the fellas looking at, mmm
'Cause they know, soon as her song come on it's a wrap, yeah
And she loves the attention

Showin' out with her home girls
Hypnotizing all the dudes, oh

All this ice in my rolley, no wonder I play it cool
Ain't no I in team, but I got my eyes on you
I watch it bounce, when she walk
She lick her lips when she talk
I throw her in that Bentley coup√© with the top off like Mardi Gras
All that cake, come get you some filling
Like a soap opera, watch All My Children
Hit it so long that she might lose feeling
With her legs in the air, she could walk on the ceiling
Said I know she loves the attention
That she get when she move
Showin' out with her home girls
And she got me watching too, girl
And she knows
