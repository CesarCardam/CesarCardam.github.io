I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
I got it for the low low
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
I got it for the low low
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
Hit my plug, that's my cholo
'Cause he got it for the low low
If you snitchin' I go loco (go crazy)
Hit you with that treinta ocho
Thinkin' that I'm solo
50 Deep, they're like "Oh no" (no no no, please no)
Heard the feds takin' photos
I know nothing, fuck the po' po'
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Whip it through the glass nigga
I'm blowin' money fast, nigga
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
I got it for the low low
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
I got it for the low low (turn off)
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
36, That's a kilo (aqui)
Need a brick, miss my free throw (stay away)
I'm in love, just like Ne-Yo
Bustin' bustin', now he Neo
Free my homies, fuck the C.O
Fuck the judge, fuck my P.O
All this coke like I'm Nino
Water whip like I'm Nemo
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Whip it through the glass, nigga
I'm blowin' money fast, nigga
I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco
I got it for the low low
I'm in love with the coco
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco)
I got it for the low low (turn off)
I'm in love with the coco (coco, coco, coco, coco)
