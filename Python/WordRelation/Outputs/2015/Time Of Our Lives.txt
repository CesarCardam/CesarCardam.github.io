39. Pitbull & Ne-YoGlobalization
I knew my rent was gon' be later 'bout a week ago
I work my ass off
But I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough
To get up in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
(Ne-yo, let's get it)
Let's get it now
This is the last $20 I got
But I'mma have a good time ballin' or out
Tell the barteneder line up some shots
'Cause I'mma get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burn up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
I told her I wanna ride out, and she said yes
We didn't go to church, but I got blessed
I knew my rent was gon' be later 'bout a week ago
I work my ass off
But I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough
To get up in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
Let's get it now
Tonight I'mma lose my mind
Better get yours cause I'm gonna get mine
Party every night like my last
Mommy know the drill, shake that ass
Go ahead baby let me see what you got
You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
And I just wanna see that thing drop
From the back to the front to the top
You know me I'm off in the cut
Always like a Squirrel, looking for a nut
This isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck
I'm not talking 'bout love, I'm talking 'bout lust
Now let's get loose, have some fun
Forget about bills and the first of the month
It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up
I knew my rent was gon' be later 'bout a week ago
I work my ass off
But I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough
To get up in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
Hey, hey, hey
Let's get it now
Everybody goin' through somethin'
(Everybody goin' through somethin')
Said, everybody goin' through somethin'
(Everybody goin' through somethin')
Say you might as well roll it up,
Pour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight
I said, everybody goin' through somethin'
(Everybody goin' through somethin')
Said, everybody goin' through somethin'
(Everybody goin' through somethin')
Say you might as well roll it up,
Pour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight
This is for anybody going through tough times
Believe it, been there, done that
But everyday above ground is a great day, remember that
I knew my rent was gon' be later 'bout a week ago
I work my ass off
But I still can't pay it though
But I got just enough
To get up in this club
Have me a good time, before my time is up
Hey, let's get it now
Ooh I want the time of my life
Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
Hey, hey, hey
Let's get it now
