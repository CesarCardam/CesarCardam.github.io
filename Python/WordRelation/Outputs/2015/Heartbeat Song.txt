91. Kelly ClarksonPiece by Piece
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night
Oh up up all night long
You, where the hell did you come from?
You were a different, different kind of fun
And still used to feel it now
Now, I got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun
I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt for a long time
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night
Oh up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turn it on
But I know you can take it up up up up all night
Oh up up all night long
I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would have had a doubt
If I don't know where I'd be know
Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
And I could do this for a long time
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night
Oh up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turn it on
But I know you can take it up up up up all night
Oh up up all night long
Until tonight I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I'll ever breathe without you
Baby you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time, one more time
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night
Oh up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turn it on
But I know you can take it up up up up all night
Oh up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night
Oh up up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turn it on
But I know you can take it up up up up all night
Oh up up all night long
