Step right up and don't be shy,
Because you will not believe your eyes.
She's right here behind the glass
And you're gonna like her,
Cause she's got class.
You can look inside another world.
You get to talk to a pretty girl.
She's everything you dream about
But don't fall in love
She's a beauty
One in a million girls,
She's a beauty.
Why would I lie?
Why would I lie?
You can say anything you like,
But you can't touch the merchandise.
She'll give you every pennies worth,
But it will cost you a dollar first.
You can step outside your little world.
You can talk to a pretty girl.
She's everything you dream about
But don't fall in love
She's a beauty
One in a million girls,
She's a beauty.
Why would I lie?
Why would I lie?
