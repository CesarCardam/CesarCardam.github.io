Well there's a little boy waitin' at the counter of a corner shop
He's been waitin' down there, waitin' half the day
They never ever seem to have the time
He gets pushed around, knocked to the ground
He gets to his feet and he says
"What About me, it isn't fair
I've had enough now I want my share
Can't you see? I want to live!
But you just take more than you give..."
Well there's a pretty girl servin' at the counter of a corner shop
She's been waitin' back there, waitin' for her dream
And dreams walk in and out, they never stop
Well she's not too proud to cry out loud
She runs to the street and she screams
"What about me, it isn't fair
I've had enough now I want my share
Can't you see? I want to live!
But you just take more than you give..." (More than you give)
Take a step back and see the little people
There's nothin there but the words that make the big people big
So listen, as they whisper
"What about me? ..."
Now we're standin' on the corner of a world gone home
Nobody's changed, nobody's been saved
And I'm feelin' cold and alone
I guess I'm lucky, I smile a lot
But sometimes I wish for more than I've got...
"What about me, it isn't fair
I've had enough now I want my share
Can't you see? I want to live!
But you just take more - What about me?!
It isn't fair!
I've had enough now I want my share!
Can't you see? I want to live!
But you just take more
You just take more
You just take more than you give...
What about me?
What about me?
What about me?
