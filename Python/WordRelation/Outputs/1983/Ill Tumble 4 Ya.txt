77. Culture ClubKissing To Be Clever
Downtown we'll drown
We're in our never splendour
Flowers, showers
Who's got the new boy gender?
I'll be your baby, I'll be your score
I'll run the gun for you and so much more
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble for you
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble
Uptown their sound is like the native you send her
Junction, function the boy with pop is slender
Did he say maybe or I'm not sure?
He'll be a boy for you but you need more
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble for you
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble
I get a crazy feeling that chases in my head
It's nothing that you do to me
It's nothing that you said
It's love in stereo
And when I can't let got I say
I'll be your baby
I'll be your score
I'll run the gun for you and so much more
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble
Downtown we'll drown
We're in our never splendour
Flowers, showers
Who's got the new boy gender?
I'll be your baby, I'll be your score
I'll run the gun for you and so much more
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble for you
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble for ya
I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble
