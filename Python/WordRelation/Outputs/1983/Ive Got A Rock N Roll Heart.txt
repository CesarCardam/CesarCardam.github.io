94. Eric Claptonalbum
I've got a feeling we could be serious, girl
Right at this moment, I could promise you the world
Before we go crazy, before we explode
There's something 'bout me, baby, you got to know, you got to know
I get off on '57 chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock n' roll, I've got a rock n' roll heart
Feels like we're falling into the arms of the night
So if you're not ready, don't be holdin' me so tight
I guess there's nothing left for me to explain
Here's what you're gettin' and I don't want to change, I don't want to change
I get off on '57 chevys
I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock n' roll, I've got a rock n' roll heart
I don't need to glitter, no hollywood
All you got to do is lay it down and you lay it down good
Well I get off on '57 chevys
Well I get off on screaming guitar
Like the way it hits me every time it hits me
I've got a rock n' roll, I've got a rock n' roll heart
I've got a, you've got a rock n' roll heart
I've got a, you've got a rock n' roll heart
I've got a, you've got a rock n' roll heart
I've got a, you've got a rock n' roll heart
