79. Sammy HagarThree Lock Box
I don't mind, when you act your age
It suits me fine, that you treat me like a child
And I can't deny, when I'm with you that you
Step outside, from all those fears locked up inside
Your love is driving me crazy
Your love just takes me away
Your love is driving me crazy
Takes me all the way
What I like, is what you've got to offer
Just my type, I don't mind playing on the edge
Your love is driving me crazy
Your love just takes me away
Your love is driving me crazy
Takes me all the way
Lead me to forbidden doors
You know I'm yours
Yeah you've got it, yeah I want it
Don't you know it babay
Right on time, a tight fit right on the money
So sublime, hot sweet cherries on the vine
Your love is driving me crazy
Your love just takes me away
Your love is driving me crazy
Takes me all the way
Your love is driving me crazy
Your love just takes me away
Your love is driving me crazy
Your love just takes me away
Your love, your love, your love just takes me away
Your love, your love, your love just takes me away
