80. Dionne WarwickOriginal Album Classics
I got to say it and it's hard for me,
You got me cryin' like I thought I would never be.
Love is believin' but you let me down;
How can I love you when you ain't around?
And I,
Get to the morning and you never call.
Love should be everything or not at all.
And it don't matter what ever you do;
I made a life out of lovin' you.
Only to find any dream that I follow is dying.
I'm cryin' in the rain.
I could be searchin' my world for a love everlasting,
Feeling no pain, when will we meet again?
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under,
My love for you.
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker,
When I was bein' what you want me to be ?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by,
This world may end, not you and I.
My love is stronger than the universe.
My soul is cryin' for you,
And that can not be reversed.
You made the rules and you could not see;
You made a life out of hurtin' me.
Out of my mind, I am held by the power of you love.
Tell me when do we try, or should we say goodbye ?
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker,
When I was bein' what you want me to be ?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by.
Oh, why do you have to be a heartbreaker ?
Is it a lesson that I never knew ?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted,
My love for you, oh,
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker,
When I was bein' what you want me to be ?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
