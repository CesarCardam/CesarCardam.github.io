18. David BowieThe Best Of Bowie
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playing on the radio
Let's sway
While color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space
If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower
