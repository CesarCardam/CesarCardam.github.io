55. Duran DuranGreatest
So soon just after you've gone
My senses sharpen
But it always takes so damn long
Before I feel how much my eyes have darkened
Fear hangs in a plane of gun smoke
Drifting in our room
So easy to disturb, with a thought, with a whisper
With a careless memory, with a careless memory
On the table, signs of love lies scattered
And the walls break, with a crashing within
It's not as though, as though you really mattered
But being close, how could I let you go
Without some feeling, some precious sympathy following
Fear hangs in a plane of gun smoke
Drifting in our room
So easy to disturb with a thought, with a whisper
With a careless memory, with a careless memory
With a careless memory, with a careless memory
I walk out into the sun, I try to find a new day
But the whole place just screams in my eyes
Where are you now 'cause I don't want to meet you
I think I'd die, I think I'd laugh at you
I know I'd cry, what am I supposed to do, follow you
Outside the thoughts coming flooding back now
I just try to forget you
So easy to disturb with a thought with a whisper
With a careless memory, with a careless memory
With a careless memory, look out
With a careless memory
With a careless memory
Look out
Look out
Look out
Look out
