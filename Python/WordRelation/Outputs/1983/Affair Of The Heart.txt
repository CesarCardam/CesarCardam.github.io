57. Rick SpringfieldStripped Down
Heart in my mouth, pulse in my head
Mercury rising into the red
The smell of your skin can light up all the fires in me
Hungry to touch, I'm eager to please
Out of control and I hand you the keys
Every night I am burning to make love to you
But don't try to tell me you think it's all physical
It goes much deeper than that
You ought to know it's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe
It's an affair of the heart
When we make love, it's a passionate thing
You shudder and shake, sink you teeth in my skin
I almost believe you were made to be played by my
hands
And you got the power, it amazes me still
How you play my emotions with consummate skill
I don't have to look any further than into your eyes
So don't try to tell me you think it's just physical
It goes way deeper than that
You better know it's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe
It's an affair of the heart
Don't try to tell me you think it's all physical
It goes much deeper than that
You ought to know it's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
You better know it's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
You better know it's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
Baby, an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
