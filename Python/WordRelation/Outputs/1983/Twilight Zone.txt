19. Golden EarringCut
Somewhere in a lonely hotel room
There's a guy starting to realize that eternal
Fate has turned its back on him.
It's two a.m.
It's two a.m.
The fear has gone
I'm sitting her waitin'
The gun's still warm
Maybe my connection is tired of taking chances
Yeah there's a storm on the loose
Sirens in my head
Wrapped up in silence
All circuits are dead
Cannot decode my whole life spins into a frenzy
[Chorus]
Help I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
The place is a madhouse
Feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved
Under moon and star
Where am I to go
Now that I've gone too far [Repeat]
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
I'm falling down a spiral
Destination unknown
Double crossed messenger, all alone
Can't get no connection
Can't get through where are you
Well the night weighs heavy
On his guilty mind
This far from the borderline
When the hit-man comes
He knows damn well
He has been cheated
And he says
[Chorus]
