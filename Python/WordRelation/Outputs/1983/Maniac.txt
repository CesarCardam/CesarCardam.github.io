09. Michael SembelloManiac
Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Looking for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy
Locking rhythm to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She had danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance
It can cut you like a knife
if the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
On the ice blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery,
Touch it but can't hold it
You work all your life, for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push shove world
But there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night
There's a cold connective heat
Struggling stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind
She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
It can cut you like a knife
If the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be
She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
I sure know, and she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
