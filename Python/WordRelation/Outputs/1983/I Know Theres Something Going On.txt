I can see that it won't be long
You grow cold when you keep holding on
You know you've changed and your words they lie
That's something you can't deny
I know there's something going on
I know there's something going on
I know it won't be long
Won't be long before you're gone
There's something going on
There's something going on
I know a good thing must come to an end
But it's hard to take loosing a friend
I know what you think and what's in your mind
So darling don't pretend
I know there's something going on.
