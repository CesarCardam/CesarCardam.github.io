13. Dexy's Midnight RunnersToo-Rye-Ay
Come on Eileen
Come on Eileen
Poor old Johnny Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
But he moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried, sang along, who'd blame them
You're grown (so grown up)
So grown (so grown up) now I must say more than ever
Come on Eileen
Too ra loo ra too ra loo rye aye
And we can sing just like our fathers
Come on Eileen, oh I swear (what he means)
At this moment, you mean everything
You in that dress, my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty
Ah, come on Eileen
Come on Eileen
These people 'round here
Wear beat down eyes sunk in smoke dried faces
They're resigned to what their fate is
But not us, (no never) no not us (no never)
We are far to young and clever
Remember
Too ra loo ra too ra loo rye aye
And you'l hum this tune forever
Come on Eileen oh I swear (what he means)
Ah come on lets, take off everything
That pretty red dress, Eileen (tell him yes)
Ah come on lets, ah come on Eileen
That pretty red dress, Eileen (tell him yes)
Ah come on lets, ah come on Eileen, please
Come on Eileen too rye aye
Come on Eileen too rye aye
Now you're full grown
Now you have shown
Oh, Eileen
Said, come on Eileen
These things they are real and I know
How you feel
Now I must say more than ever
Things round here have changed
I say, too ra loo ra, too ra-loo rye aye
Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (what he means)
At this moment, you mean everything
You in that dress, my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty
Aah, come on Eileen
Oh, come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (what he means)
At this moment, you mean everything
In that dress, oh my thoughts I confess
Well, they're dirty
Come on Eileen
Come on Eileen
