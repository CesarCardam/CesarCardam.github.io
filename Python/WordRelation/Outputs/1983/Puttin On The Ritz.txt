31. TacoPuttin&#039; On The Ritz
If you're blue and you don't know
Where to go to, why don't you go
Where fashion sits? Puttin' on the Ritz
Different types who wear a day
Coat pants with stripes and cutaway
Coat perfect fits, puttin' on the Ritz
Dressed up like a million-dollar trooper
Tryin' hard to look like Gary Cooper
(Super duper)
Come let's mix where Rock-a-fellas
Walk with sticks or umbrellas
In their mitts, puttin' on the Ritz
Have you seen the well-to-do, up and down Park Avenue
On that famous thoroughfare with their noses in the air
High hats and arrow collars, white spats and lots of dollars
Spending every dime for a wonderful time
If you're blue and you don't know
Where to go to, why don't you go
Where fashion sits? Puttin' on the Ritz
Different types who wear a day
Coat pants with stripes and cutaway
Coat perfect fits, puttin' on the Ritz
Dressed up like a million-dollar trooper
Tryin' hard to look like Gary Cooper
(Super duper)
Come let's mix where Rock-a-fellas
Walk with sticks or umbrellas
In their mitts, puttin' on the Ritz
Dressed up like a million-dollar trooper
Tryin' hard to look like Gary Cooper
(Super duper)
If you're blue and you don't know
Where to go to, why don't you go
Where fashion sits? Puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on the Ritz, puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on the Ritz
Move, move, gotta dance, gotta dance
If you're blue and you don't know
Where to go to, why don't you go?
Where fashion sits, puttin' on the Ritz
Puttin' on the Ritz, puttin' on the Ritz
