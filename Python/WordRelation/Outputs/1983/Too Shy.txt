Time (after) time, (I'm) short of breath, don't even try
Try a little harder
Something's wrong, you're not naive,
You must must be strong
Oh, baby, try
Hey girl, move a little closer
'Cause you're too shy shy
Hush hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy
Hush hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy
Hush hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy
Hush hush
Modern medicine falls short of your complaints
Try a little harder
You're moving in circles,
Won't you dilate
Mmm, baby try
Hey girl, move a little closer
'Cause you're too shy shy
Hush hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy
Hush hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy
Hush hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy
Hush hush
Too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too
Too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too
Too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too
Too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too
You're too shy shy
Hush hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy
Hush hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy
Hush hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy
Hush hush
Too shy shy
Hush hush, eye to eye
Too shy shy
Hush hush, eye to eye
