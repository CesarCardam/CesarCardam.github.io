34. Culture ClubKissing To Be Clever
Don't put your head on my shoulder
Sink me in a river of tears
This could be the best place yet
But you must overcome your fears
Ooh in time it could have been so much more
The time is precious I know
In time it could have been so much more
The time has nothing to show because
Time won't give me time and
Time makes lovers feel like they've got something real
But you and me we know they've got nothing but time
And time won't give me time, won't give me time (time, time, time)
Don't make me feel any colder
Time is like a clock in my heart
Touch me touch was the key too much
I felt I lost you from the start
Ooh in time it could have been so much more
The time is precious I know
In time it could have been so much more
The time has nothing to show because
Time won't give me time and
Time makes lovers feel like they've got something real
But you and me we know they've got nothing but time
And time won't give me time, won't give me time (time, time, time)
Ooh in time it could have been so much more
The time is precious I know
In time it could have been so much more
The time has nothing to show because
Time won't give me time and
Time makes lovers feel like they've got something real
But you and me we know they've got nothing but time
And you know time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel like they've got something real
But you and me we know they've got nothing but time
And you know time won't give me time
And time makes lovers feel like they've got something real
