51. Adam Antalbum
Adam ant / Marco pirroni
With the heartbreak open
So much you cant hide
Put on a little makeup makeup
Make sure they get your good side good side
If the words unspoken
Get stuck in your throat
Send a treasure token token
Write it on a pound note pound note
Dont drink dont smoke - what do you do?
Dont drink dont smoke - what do you do?
Subtle innuends follow
There must be something inside hes hiding
We dont follow fashion
That would be a joke
You know were going to set them set them
So everyone can take note take note
When they saw you kneeling
Crying words that you mean
Opening their eyeballs eyeballs
Pretending that youre al green al green
No ones gonna tell me
Whats wrong or whats right
Or tell me who to eat with sleep with
Or that Ive won the big fight big fight
Look out or theyll tell you
Youre a superstar
Two weeks and youre an all time legend
I think the games have gone much too far
If the words unspoken
Get stuck in your throat
Send a treasure token token
Write it on a pound note pound note
Dont drink dont smoke - what do you do?
Dont drink...
