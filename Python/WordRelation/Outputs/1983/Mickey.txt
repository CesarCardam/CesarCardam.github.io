36. Toni BasilThe Best Of: Mickey And Other Love Songs
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey,
Hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey,
Hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey,
Hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey,
Hey Mickey!
You've been around all night and that's a little long
You think you've got the right but I think you've got it wrong
Why can't you say goodnight so you can take me home, Mickey
'Cause when you say you will, it always means you won't
You're givin' me the chills, baby, please baby don't
Every night you still leave me all alone, Mickey
Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand
It's guys like you Mickey
Oh, what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey
Hey Mickey!
Now when you take me by the hooves everyone's gonna know
Every time you move I let a little more show
There's somethin' we can use, so don't say no, Mickey
So come on and give it to me any way you can
Any way you wanna do it, I'll treat you like a man
Oh please, baby, please, don't leave me in a jam, Mickey
Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand
It's guys like you Mickey
Oh, what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey
Hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey
Hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey
Hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey
Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand
It's guys like you Mickey
Oh, what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey
Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand
It's guys like you Mickey
Oh, what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey
Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand
It's guys like you Mickey
Oh, what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey
Oh Mickey, what a pity you don't understand
You take me by the heart when you take me by the hand
Oh Mickey, you're so pretty, can't you understand
It's guys like you Mickey
