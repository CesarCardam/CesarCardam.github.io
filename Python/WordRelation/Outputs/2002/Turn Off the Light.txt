92. Nelly FurtadoWhoa Nelly!
(People, people, people)
It's getting so lonely inside this bed
Don't know if I should lick my wounds or say woe is me instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me you're better off alone
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see if you will get some
They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down
'Til you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems
I looked above the other day
'Cause I think I'm good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon (by the moon)
If it's high play it low, if it's harvest go slow and if it's full, then go
But after midnight morning will come
And the day will see if you're gonna get some
They say that girl ya know she act too tough tough tough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough rough rough
Well it's 'til I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down
'Til you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems
And I'm searching for things that I just cannot see
Why don't you don't you don't you come and be with me
I pretend to be cool with me, want to believe
That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
Or is it love that I'm looking to find
It's all in me, can't you see, why can't you, why can't you see it's all in me, yeah
All in me, yeah
Where is your logic
Turn of the light, turn off the light
Who do you need
Turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me follow me follow me down down down down
Where can you turn
'Til you see all my dreams
Where is your logic
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems
Who do you need
Follow me follow me follow me down down
Turn off the light, turn off the light
Follow me follow me follow me down down
Turn off the light, turn off the light
Where is your light, yeah
Turn off the light, turn off the light
Who do you need
Where can you turn
Turn off the light, turn off the light
