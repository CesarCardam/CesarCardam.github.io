32. No Doubt Featuring Bounty KillerRock Steady
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say,boys say,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey
Hey baby baby
I'm the kinda girl that hangs with the guys
Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes
Taking it in, try to be feminine
With my makeup bag watching all the sin
Misfit, I sit, lit up, wicked
Everybody else surrounded by the girls
With the tank tops and the flirty ways
I'm just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school
All the boys say,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say, girls say,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Hey baby baby
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
All the boys get the girls in the back
I'm the one they feed upon
Give a bit a star is born
And if you had enough you'll get the pass
And you can tell your friends how you made it back
No matter what they say I'm still the same
Somehow everybody knows my name
And all the girls want to get with the boys
And the boys really like it
All the boys say,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say, girls say,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Hey baby baby
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
All the boys get the girls in the back
Check it out, it's Bounty Killer, and no doubt
Jump on the stage makes me going crazy
After wards myself and one of them gorgeous ladies(that's right)
There is no need to be acting shady
Come on baby, hey hey baby
Jump on the stage makes me going crazy
After wards myself and one of them gorgeous ladies(yea man)
There is no need to be acting shady
Come on baby, hey hey baby
When you rock your hips you know that it amaze me
Got me off the hook and nothing else don't phase me
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady
If no, no maybe, hey
I'm just sipping on chamomile
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom
And went to my high school
(hey baby, hey baby)(that's right)
All the boys say,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say, girls say,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Hey baby baby (hey baby)
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Can you be my one and only sunshine lady
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Girls say, girls say,
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
When you rock your hips you know that it amaze me
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
Boys say, boys say
Hey baby, hey baby, hey!
All the boys get the girls in the back
