76. Ja Rule Featuring CaseExodus
Yea, yea, yea
Where all my...
Uhh, yea.. c'mon, c'mon uhh
To all my bitches that be givin it up, uh
To all my niggaz that be livin it up, we say...
To all my bitches that be givin it up, ah
C'mon
Baby, this ain't your typical, everyday, one night thing
It's a physical, I'ma fuck you tonight thing
Fuck, knowin your name, jump yo' ass in the Range
And roll over, gettin blown while blowin the doja
Bring head to a closure - that's a good bitch
Before it's all over, I'ma meat this bitch
Probably treat this bitch, mo' betta
Cause if you ain't - know, gangstas and hoes go together
Poppin my collar potnah - who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot; and the mug and the watch ugly
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me cause they ain't fucked me
And they say I'm lucky; you think I got time
to fuck all these hoes and do all these shows?
Or flight in the llama chargin white Rolls
Uhh-oh, another episode
What, do I do?
To all my niggaz that be livin it up, we say
What, I do
To all my bitches that be givin it up, uhh
What, youuuuuu do
To all my niggaz that be livin it up, we say
What, do I do?
To all my bitches that be givin it up, uhh
My loooooooove's for you
C'mon
Bitches, just wanna hold a name that's active
That's why they suck dick with mo' passion than average
And I ain't mad at'cha; never leave you alone
Cause we fucks when I'm home, phone sex when I'm gone
We both grown, both got minds of our own
Plus I freaks off like O-Dog in "Love Jones"
Been in, many zones, baby one hoes, two hoes
From, prissy bitches to hoes that do porno
But you know, the Rule be livin it up
And got all these hoes, givin it up
I like a, little ooh baby, how cute are you?
With a body that rides on sexual
I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you
Do a doughnut, and cut, then I'll open it up
On the freeway, dick in her mouth, foot on the clutch
Rule bitch, not givin a fuck
What, do I do?
To all my niggaz that be livin it up, we say
What, I do
To all my bitches that be givin it up, uhh

C'mon
C'mon, we get hiiiigh
C'mon, we get riiiight
C'mon, we get liiiive
Live yo' life
Love you so sexy, I just want you next to me
Your whole vibe, like you high on ecstasy
Cause ain't nuttin but a 'E' thang bay-bay
I know that pussy wet like cra-zay
I wanna, feel your passion, come when you askin
Laugh when you cryin, cry when you laughin
But ain't nuttin happenin, the bitch got a little too high
licked up my thigh then started crashin
The radio blastin "Between Me and You"
But, you ain't on the low with that freak shit you do
Girl I thought you knew (what I do), know I know (what you do)
Cause it's ain't a good night if the head ain't right
Like, Teddy P let's "Turn Off the Lights"
And, grind it out, takin no times out
'til the sun come out; bitch, lemme find out
What, do I do?
To all my niggaz that be livin it up, we say
What, I do
To all my bitches that be givin it up, uhh
What, youuuuuu do
