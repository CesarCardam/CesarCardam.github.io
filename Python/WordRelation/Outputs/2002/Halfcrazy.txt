Never thought that we would ever be more than friends
Now I'm all confused cuz for you, I have deeper feelings
We both thought it was cool to cross the line
And I was convinced it would be alright
Now things are strange, nothings the same
And really I just want my friend back
And my mind's gone half crazy cuz I can't leave you alone
(Oh can't get you out of my system)
And I wonder if, if it's worth me holding on (holding on)
Said my mind's gone half crazy cuz I can't leave you alone
(can't get you out of my system)
And I wonder if, if it's worth me holding on
I'd to hate walk away from you as if this never existed
Cause when we kissed, the moment after I looked at you different (yea)
Lately I gotta watch what I say
Cause you take things personal nowadays
You used to laugh now you get mad
Damn, I just want my friend back
And my mind's gone half crazy cuz I can't leave you alone
(Oh can't get you out of my system)
And I wonder if, if it's worth me holding on (holding on)
Said my mind's gone half crazy cuz I can't leave you alone
(can't get you out of my system)
And I wonder if, if it's worth me holding on
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah
What happened to the one I used to know (oh yeah yeah)
The one I used to laugh and joke with
The one I used to tell all my secrets
We used to chill and be down for
Whatever
Whenever
Together yeah
And my mind's gone half crazy (oh) cuz I can't leave you alone (I'm going half
Crazy baby)
And I wonder if, if it's worth me holding on (over you yeah yea oh)
Said my mind's gone half crazy (yeah oh) cuz I can't leave you alone (and I
Just don't know)
And I wonder if it's worth me holding on (said I just don't know what to do now)
Listen, we used to chill (yeah) we used to hang (yeah)
We used to, we used to do so many things together (yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah
Oh oh oh
