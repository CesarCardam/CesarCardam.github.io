50. Big TymersHood Rich
Whassup Fresh? It's our turn, baby
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits (with the Gucci suits)
Ain't got no job, but I stay suave (I stay suave)
Can't pay my rent, 'cause all my money's spent (I can't pay my rent)
But that's okay, 'cause I'm Still Fly (Damn! 'Cause I'm so fly)
Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E class (in my E-Class Benz)
But that's alright, cause I'm gon' ride
Got everything in my momma name (We got everything, in my momma name)
But I'm Hood Rich (uh huh!)
Get your k-uh, k-uh-car, play gems gone shine
And tell momma get a mink - baby girl let's ride (let's ride)
You a number one stunna, and we gon' glide
And go straight to the mall and tear down the inside
Do that Prada, Gucci, full length leather
Bourbon's cool or Coogi sweater (sweater)
Twenty-inches pop my feather
The Birdman daddy I fly in any weather
Alligator seats with the head in the inside
Swine on the dash, G-wagon is So Fly
Number one don't tangle and twist it
When it come to these cars I am that nigga
The k-uh, k-uh-Coogi with the matchin' interior
Three wheel ride with the tire in the middle
It's Fresh and Stunna, and we like brothers
We shine like paint daddy, it's our summer
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp
Can't pay my rent, 'cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, 'cause I'm Still Fly
Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E class
But that's alright, 'cause I'm gon' ride
Got everything in my momma name
But I'm Hood Rich
Have you ever seen a crocodile seats in the truck
Turn around sit it down and let 'em bite your butt
See the steering wheel is Fendi, dashboard Armani
With your baby momma player, is where you can find me?
Cruisin' through the parking lot on twenty fours
(Coming Through The Hood On 'Em Twenty Fo's)
Cadillac Escalade with the chromed out nose
With an navigation arrow headed straight to your spot
Where your wife really love me cause the sex is so hot
Put the Caddy up, start the three wheel Benz (skirt!)
Hyper white lights, ultra-violet lens
Suma-tuma tires and they gotta be run flat
TV where the horn go, "Boy can you top that?"
I'ma show you some shit rookie press that button
The trunk went and all of a sudden
Four fifteen's didn't see no wires
And then I heard (boom!) from the amplifiers
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp
Can't pay my rent, 'cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, 'cause I'm Still Fly
Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E class
But that's alright, 'cause I'm gon' ride
Got everything in my momma name
But I'm Hood Rich
(Ay, ay, ay, ay)
Lemme slide in the Benz (shit!) with the fished out fins
Impala loud pipes, drinkin' the Henn'
It's the Birdie-Birdie Man I'll do it again
In a Cadillac truck twenty-fours with tens
Looking at my Gucci it's about that time
Six bad broads flying in at nine
New Suburban Truck with the porno showing
Up and down and up they go and
Bodies on the Roadster Lexus you know what?
That hard-top beamer (ay, ay) yo Ma', that's your truck
I'm comin' up, the hood been lovely
New shoes on the whip and I wake up to bubbly (bubbly)
Four-thirty Lex with the convertible top
And the rims keeps spinning every time I stop
Got a superman Benz that I scored from Shaq
With a ol' school Caddy with a "diamond in the back"
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp
Can't pay my rent, 'cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, 'cause I'm Still Fly
Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E class
But that's alright, 'cause I'm gon' ride
Got everything in my momma name
But I'm Hood Rich
The Number One Stunna Pimp
