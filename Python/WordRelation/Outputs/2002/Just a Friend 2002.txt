Ya'll ready fo' me?
Ahh
I want to know your name and
I want to know if you gotta man
I want to know
I want to know everything
I want to know your number and if I can come over and
I want to know whatcha like
I want to know so I can do it all night
Butcha tellin' me I'm just a friend
Tellin' me I'm just a friend
[Chorus]
Oh baby you
Got what I need (got what I need)
But you say I'm just a friend (Say I'm Just A Friend)
But you say I'm just a friend (Say I'm Just A Friend)
'Cause I can be your fantasy
But you say I'm just a friend
But you say I'm just a friend
I want to know you in and out
I want to know what your all about
I want to know
I want to know what makes you laugh
I want to know about your past
I want to know how you move
I want to know so I can move too
I want to know
But your tellin' me I'm just a friend
Tellin' me I'm just a friend
[Chorus: x3]
Can you
Give me one reason why
You wouldn't want this kind of guy
'Cause I stay dips
I stay lace
And I know you know I'm fly
Girl stop playing games with me
And let get it on tonight
You got nothing to lose
Let me do what I do
