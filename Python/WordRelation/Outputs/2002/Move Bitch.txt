You see them headlights? You hear that fuckin' crowd?
Start that goddamn show, I'm comin' through
Hit the stage and knock the curtains down
I fuck the crowd up, that's what I do
Young and successful, a sex symbol
The bitches want me to fuck, true true
Hold up wait up, shorty

We buyin' bars out, showin' scars out
We heard there's hoes out, so we brought the cars out
Grab the pills cause we popping tonight,
Beat the shit outta security for stoppin' tha fight
I got a fifth of the remy, fuck the Belve and 'cris
I'm sellin' shit up in the club like I work in the bitch
Fuck the dress codes, it's street clothes, we all street niggas
We on the dance floor, throwin' bows, beatin' up niggas
I'm from the D.E.C., tryin' to disrespect D.T.P.
And watch the bottles start flyin' from the V.I.P.
Fuck this rap shit, we clap bitch, two in your body
Grab ya four, start a fight dog, ruin the party
So move bitch, get out the way hoe
All you faggot motherfuckers make way for 2-0
