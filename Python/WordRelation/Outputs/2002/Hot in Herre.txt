Hot in, so hot in here! So hot in, hot, oh!
With a little bit of, uh uh, and a little bit of, uh uh
Just a little bit of, just a little bit of,
Just a little bit of, just a little bit of
I was like, good gracious, ass is bodacious
Flirtatious, trying to show faces
I'm waiting for the right time to shoot my steez you know
Waiting for the right time to flash them ki's, then
I'm leaving, please believing, oh!
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check it, got it locked at the top of the Fo' Seasons
Penthouse, roof top, birds I feeding
No deceiving, nothing up my sleeve and
No teasing I need you to
Get up up on the dance floor
Give that man what he asking for
'Cause I feel like busting loose
And I feel like touching you, uh uh
And can't nobody stop the juice
So baby tell me what's the use? I said
It's getting hot in here, so hot, so take off all your clothes
I am, getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's getting hot in here, so hot, so take off all your clothes
I am, getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
Uh, uh, uh, let it hang all out!
Why you at the bar if you ain't popping the bottles? c'mon
What good is all the fame if you ain't fucking the models
I see you driving, sports cars, ain't hitting the throttle
And I'll be down to do a hundred, top down and goggles
Get off the freeway, exit 106 and "Park"ed it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game cause baby I can't talk it
Warm, sweating, it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank top, on at this point
You with a winner so baby you can't loose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun
So take it off like your home alone
You know dance in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checking your reflection and telling your best friend
Like "Girl I think my butt getting big!"
It's getting hot in here, so hot, so take off all your clothes
I am, getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's getting hot in here, so hot, so take off all your clothes
I am, getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
Let it hang all out
Mix a little bit of
With a little bit of
Let it just fall out
Give a little bit of
With a little bit of
Let it hang all out
With a little bit of
And a sprinkle of that
Let it just fall out
I like it when ya
Girl, baby make it
Stop pacing, time wasting
I gotta a friend with a pole in the basement what?
I'm just kidding like Jason oh
Unless you gon' do it
Extra, extra, eh, spread the news check it
Nelly took a trip from the Luna to Neptunes
Came back with something thick and it fitting in sasoons
Say she got a thing about cutting in restrooms, oh
It's getting hot in here, so hot, so take off all your clothes
I am, getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's getting hot in here, so hot, so take off all your clothes
I am, getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's getting hot in here, so hot, so take off all your clothes
I am, getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's getting hot in here, so hot, so take off all your clothes
I am, getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
Let it hang all out
Mix a little bit of
With a little bit of
Let it just fall out
Give a little bit of
With a little bit of
Let it hang all out
With a little bit of
And a sprinkle of that
Let it just fall out
I like it when ya
Girl, baby make it
