60. Faith EvansFaithfully
My heart belongs to you
So what could I do
To make you feel I'm down with
You see me hangin around
But you don't know how to make me feel for you, and
Each and every day, I try to make some sense of this
What you mean to me, I know it could be serious
Each and every nite, I dream about just holding you
Loving you like this, what is a girl supposed to do
I love you
I want you
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it any more
I love you
I need you
What can I do to make you see
You're the only one for me
First time I saw your face
My heart just erased
All the guys I knew before
You walked into my life
I was the type to never want for nothing
Each and every day, I try to make some sense of this
What you mean to me, I know it could be serious
Each and every nite, I dream about just holding you
Loving you like this, what is a girl supposed to do
I love you
I want you
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it any more
I love you
I need you
What can I do to make you see
You're the only one for me
I love you, I want you, I need you in my life
Can't you see what you mean to me
Baby come hold me tight
I miss you, wanna kiss you
Everytime I see your face
Baby I'll be waiting for you
Each and everyday
I love you
I want you
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it any more
I love you
I need you
What can I do to make you see
You're the only one for me
You're the only one for me
And I know it's meant to be
What can I do to make you see
My love will carry on
So listen to my heart and know
You'll find out where my love will go
The future lies between us boy
Oh babe I love you so
I love you
I want you
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it any more
I love you
I need you
What can I do to make you see
You're the only one for me
I love you
I want you
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it any more
I love you
I need you
What can I do to make you see
You're the only one for me
