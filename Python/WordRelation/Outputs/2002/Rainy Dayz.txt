67. Mary J. Blige Featuring Ja Rulealbum
Huh yeah, Rule baby
Huh Mary J. Blige, Murder Inc.
Smile
It's just those rainy days
Spent a lifetime tryin' to wash away
'Til the sun comes out and shines again
Smile for me, smile for me
On all those rainy days
Spend ya lifetime tryin? to wash away
Until the sun shines and I see your face
Smile at me, smile at me
We're always livin' so crazy and sexy and cool
And we begin to love it (begin love it)
Watchin' all the heartache and pain of the world
And think nothing of it (thinkin' nothing of it)
Now baby I got love for you
And I know that you got me baby (got me baby)
But everytime the sun shines bright it gets socloudy
Mary: 'Cause nobody loves the rain
Ja: can't stand it
It always seem to fall
Mary: Baby handle it
Baby didn't we tell you before about chasin?those waterfalls?
Yeah
Mary: Nobody loves the rain
Ja: Can't stand it
It always seems to fall
Mary: Baby handle it
Baby didn't we tell you before about chasin?those waterfalls
Yeah
Mary baby, sometimes the Rule don't mind the rain
It kinda feels like I'm drownin' in the Lord's pain
Until the sun comes out and shines again, smile
Gimme reason to keep believin' that everything ain't is mean and
I kiss the clouds on the rainy days
And smile for you when the skies are gray
Baby 'cause I'm a teardrop away from cryin'
And a few shots away from dyin'
Dear Lord would you shower my pain
Let it rain, let it rain on me
While I cherish the air I breathe
I'm an angel- that can't soar, can't fly
And I imagine the Lord knows why
I feel like an angel in my broken wings
So I can soar again, Lord let me in
And through all the passion and the pain and the hurt
I feel like I'm fallin' (yeah)
Makin' promises of love to those that spread love
And for those that can't take it, stand up
Baby we goin' make it and the words of Marvin Gaye
"War is not the answer"
Smile smile smile smile smile sm-smile sm-smile
'Til the sun shines
Just smile for me
Just smile for me, just smile at me
Know in your heart that we are free
Free to believe whatever we feel
So feel something real baby, yeah
