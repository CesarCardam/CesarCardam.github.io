61. Daniel BedingfieldGotta Get Thru This
If only I could get through this
I just gotta get through this
I just gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta make it, gonna make, gonna make it through
Said I'm gonna get through this
I'm gonna get through this
I gotta take, gotta take my mind off you
Give me just a second and I'll be all right
Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart
Give me 'til tomorrow then I'll be okay
Just another day and then I'll hold you tight
When your love is pouring like the rain
I close my eyes and it's gone again
When will I get the chance to say I love you
I pretend that you're already mine
Then my heart ain't breaking every time
I look into your eyes
If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
God, God gotta help me get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta make it, gonna make, gonna make it through
Said I'm gonna get through this
I'm gonna get through this
I gotta take, gotta take my mind off you
Give me just a second and I'll be all right
Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart
Give me 'til tomorrow then I'll be okay
Just another day and then I'll hold you tight
When your love is pouring like the rain
I close my eyes and it's gone again
When will I get the chance to say I love you
I pretend that you're already mine
Then my heart ain't breaking every time
I look into your eyes
If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
I just gotta get through this
God, God gotta help me get through this
If only I could get through this
I just gotta get through this
God, God gotta help me get through this
If only I could get through this
I just gotta get through this
God, God gotta help me get through this
I just gotta get through this
I just gotta get through this
I just gotta get through this
