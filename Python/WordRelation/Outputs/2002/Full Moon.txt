89. BrandyFull Moon
Boy
I saw you soon as you came bouncing through the door
You and your mans and them just took over floor
Started doing your thing and it made me notice you even more
The way you turned around ant looked at me it seemed as though
You must have somehow felt me staring on the low
Something tells me your the kinda guy i'd like to get to know
I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been giving you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it cracking if you like
Must be a full moon
Feels like one of those nights
Why is this the first time that i'm seeing you around?
Could you be visiting or are you new in town?
Whatever the case, I'm feeling you right here and right now
Your smile and all the love you show me let's me know that you
Like what you see and want to get to know me too
This could very well be the start of something special
Happy that I met you
I ain't even gonna front
I ain't even gonna lie
Since you walked up in the club
I've been giving you the eye
We can dance if you want
Get it cracking if you like
Must be a full moon
Feels like one of those nights
