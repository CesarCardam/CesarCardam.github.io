Whoo!
Yeah, darkchild
B, Rock let's go
Why don't you return my calls
Why you trip 'bout where I be
You don't ever come to see me
You say that you're too busy
What the hell, I don't have time
Why you messing with my mind
I can find another guy
Someone who will treat me right
I don't need this bull
I won't put up with it, any longer
You can, go if you want
I don't need you pity
I will be just fine
If you decide that you want to leave
Close the door behind you
I just want to know what
[Chorus]
What about all of the
Things that you say
What about all of the
Promises that you made
What about all of the
Eyes that you gave
What about all of the
Things you told me
What about all of the
Things that you say
What about all of the
Promises that you made
What about all of the
Eyes that you gave
What about, what about
What about us, what about us
What about us, what about us
Thought you said you were different
Was that what I heard you say
Said that you loved only me
Thought that you'd be all I need
What happened to promises
Said that you were a better man
Your words have no weight with me
Cause you're counterfeit I see
I don't need this bull
I won't put up with it, any longer
You can, go if you want
I don't need you pity
I will be just fine
If you decide that you want to leave
Close the door behind you
I just want to know what
[Chorus]
Baby check it out hear this
Now what if I said that you
Wasn't fit to be with
Now what if I told you the game
We played, I picked it
Now what if I said I wasn't true
So do you
You and I know without me
There's no you
Now what about the bills that were past due
Paid for you, and all you said to me is Baby I owe you
Forget about the brand new life
That I gave you
Don't what about us to me
Cause we are through
[Chorus: x2]
