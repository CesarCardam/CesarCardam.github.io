Boy you know you make me float
Boy you really get me high, hoo
I feel like I'm on dope
'Cause you, you serve me on a regular
Boy we need to tie this rope
Before we drift any deeper
There now hold me close
Boy let's take this overboard now
I want you to rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions
New positions new position, new position
Stroke it baby
Stroke it for me
stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Ooh baby I love your stroke
'Cause you, cause you get me where I'm going
In a jury you'll get my vote
'Cause I believe
I believe you know just what you doing now
Baby now we can coast
Just don't get in a hurry
That's too slow
Go ahead and put that thing in overdrive
I want you to rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions
New position, new position, new position
Stroke it baby
Stroke for me
Stroke it on me, stroke it on me
I want you to rock the boat
Rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions
New position, new position, new position
Stroke it baby
Stroke for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me
Stroke it baby, stroke it baby
Work it it baby, work it baby
Ooh stroke it
Baby stroke it I want you for me
I need you to use yourself
Like you never ever used it before (never)
To explore my body (explore it baby)
Until you reach the shore
You'll be calling, calling for more
Rock the boat, baby rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle (work it baby , work it baby)
Change positions
New position, new position, new position
Stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Stroke it for me
I want you to rock the boat
Baby rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work it in the middle
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions
New position, new position, new position
Stroke it for me
Stroke for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Rock the boat
Baby rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
Work the middle
Work the middle, work the middle, work the middle
Change positions
New position, new position, new position
Stroke it for me
Stroke it for me
Stroke it for me, stroke it for me
Rock the boat
Baby rock the boat, rock the boat, rock the boat
