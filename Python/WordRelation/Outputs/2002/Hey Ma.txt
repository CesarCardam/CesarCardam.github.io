Yo, now I was downtown clubbin, ladies night

Plus I'll tell you what the 80's like
And i know what the ladies like
Need a man that's polite,listens,and takes advice
I could be all three, plus I could lay the pipe
Come wit me, come stay the night
She looked at me laughin' , like boy your game is tight
I'm laughin' back like sho' ya right

And don't touch nothing, sit in the car

Ready to bone, ready for dome

High heel dooby feel, plus got them Gucci nails on
You a cutie still, and this my down girl too
Ain't no groupie deal
We left the movies with Uzies,Suzuki wheels

Go to the crib she got the Gucci linen'
I see Boo be grinning
She looked and said Cam, I know that you be sinning
Naw, I'm a changed man, look at the range man

Looked and said that's nothing but game Cam
She was right, she was up in the Range man
Droped her off at the L, now I'm flippin' the cell
That's right I had to call up L
