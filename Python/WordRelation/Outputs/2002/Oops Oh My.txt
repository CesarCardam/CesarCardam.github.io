I'll tell ya what I did last night
I came home, say around a quarter to three
Still so high, hypnotized
In a trance, from his body
So buttery brown and tantalizing
You would have thought I needed help
With the feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath
Oops! There goes my shirt up over my head, oh my
Oops! There goes my skirt droppin' to my feet, oh my
Oh! Some kind of touch caressing my legs, oh my
Oh! I'm turnin' red who could this be
I tried and I tried to avoid
But this thing was happening
Swallow my pride, let it ride
And parted, but this body felt just like mine
I got worried
I looked over to the left
A reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath
Oops! There goes my shirt up over my head, oh my
Oops! There goes my skirt droppin' to my feet, oh my
Oh! Some kind of touch caressing my legs, oh my
Oh! I'm turnin' red who could this be
I looked over to my left
Mmm, I was lookin' so good I couldn't reject myself
I looked over to my left
Mmm, I was feelin' so good I had to touch myself
I looked over to the left
Mmm, I was eyein' my thighs, butter pecan brown
I looked over to the left
Mmm, Coming out of my shirt and then my skirt came down
Oops! There goes my shirt up over my head, oh my
Oops! There goes my skirt droppin' to my feet, oh my
Oh! Some kind of touch caressing my legs, oh my
Oh! I'm turnin' red who could this be
Oops! There goes my shirt up over my head, oh my
Oops! There goes my skirt droppin' to my feet, oh my
Oh! Some kind of touch caressing my legs, oh my
Oh! I'm turnin' red who could this be
