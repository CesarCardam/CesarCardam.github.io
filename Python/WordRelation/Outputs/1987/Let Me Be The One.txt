Sometimes people play with love falling in love is just a game
Don't think I don't know love you'll never be alone again
Let me
Show you how I feel
Be the one
That you need so much
Let me
Give you what you thrill
Be the one
That I long to touch
Only you can make me feel this way
I give you all come on let's get away
Something that will never ever fade
I give you more and more so
Let me be the one
Hold on to the dream
Let me be the one
You can trust me at any time
Let me be the one
Give you my love
Let me be the one
To feel your tender touch
First time that I saw you there all I knew you brought before
From this need you will never leave cause I will never let you go
Let me
Hold you close to me
Be the one
Because our love is strong
Let me
Feel the need in me
Be the one
Together we belong
Only you can make me feel brand new
I can feel it in my heart your love is true
Together we are one instead of two
I want you more and more so
Let me be the one
Hold on to the dream
Let me be the one
You can trust me at any time
Let me be the one
I want to give you my love
Let me be the one
Be the one
Only you can make me feel this way
I give you all come on lets get away
Something that will never ever fade
I give you more and more so
Let me be the one
Hold on to the dream
Let me be the one
You can trust me at any time
Let me be the one
Give you my love
Let me be the one
To feel your tender touch
