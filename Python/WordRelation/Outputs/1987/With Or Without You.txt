See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait, without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
