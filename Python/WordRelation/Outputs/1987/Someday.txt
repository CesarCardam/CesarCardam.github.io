ohhhhh!!
When I come home you telephone,and say your waiting for me.
I ask you why, I hear you cry,cause your still waiting for me.
Chorous:
Someday you'll be shedding your tears to cry over me.
Someday I'll be loosing this fear.
Now I'm alone no telephone and tell me you don't need me.
I ask you why and tell me lies and say the truth would hurt me.
OOOOOOH!
Chorous:
Someday you'll be shedding your tears to cry over me.
Someday I'll be loosing this fear.
OHHHHH! OHHHHH! someday.
OHHHHHH!
Down in the streets where lovers meet.
That's where I'm waiting for you.
In the streets where lovers meet, I'm still waiting for you.
Chorous
Someday You'll be shedding your tears and then you'll cry over me.
Someday I'll be loosing this fear. OOOHH
Someday you'll be shedding your tears, and then you'll cry over me.
Someday I'll be loosing this fear. OHHHHH
