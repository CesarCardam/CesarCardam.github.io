Who needs friends who never show
I'll tell you what you want to know
I could have saved a broken heart
If I'd found out long ago
I'm just thinking about
Those lonely nights
When I waited for your call
'Til I found out
All my friends were right, ooh, ooh
I didn't know you at all
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, yes I did, boy
I heard a rumour, ooh
Now it seems they're telling me
You've changed your wicked ways
But should I give you a second chance
Baby, I'm too afraid
So you realize what hurt you made
And the love you threw away
How can I forgive or soon forget
It's never gonna be the same
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, yes I did, boy
I heard a rumour, ooh
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, yes I did, boy
I heard a rumour, ooh
I'm just thinking about
Those lonely nights
When I waited for your call
'Til I found out
All my friends were right, ooh, ooh
I didn't know you at all
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, I heard a rumour
They say you got a broken heart
I heard a rumour
Ooh, ooh, yes I did, boy
I heard a rumour, ooh
