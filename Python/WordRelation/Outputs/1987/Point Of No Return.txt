Common love, seems just like a dream
It's no mystery to me
Fill me within when we're together
Oh baby can't you see
I'd like to feel the passion
To the point of no return
I will be in full reaction
I want to take you in my arms
You're taking me to the point of no return
(Uh uh)
You're taking me to the point of no return
It's so long, life of denial
The love you give to me
And when you smile
It warms my heart and me
Oh baby can't you see
I like to feel the passion to the point of no return
Oh baby, I will be in full reaction
I want to take you in my arms
You're taking me to the point of no return
You're taking me to the point of no return
I want to be with you baby
I want to be by your side
I want to be with you baby
I want to love you every evening
You're taking me to the point of no return
You're taking me to the point of no return
You're taking me to the point of no return
You're taking me to the point of no return
You're taking me to the point of no return
