09. Bob SegerGreatest Hits, Vol. 2
No matter what you think you pull you'll find it's not enough
No matter who you think you know you won't get through
It's a given L.A. law
Someone's faster on the draw
No matter where you hide I'm comin' after you yeah
No matter how the race is run it always ends the same
Another room without a view awaits downtown
You can shake me for a while
Live it up in style
No matter what you do I'm gonna take you down
Shakedown

Takedown
Everybody wants into the crowded line

Takedown
You're busted
Let down
Your guard
Honey, just about the time you're thinkin' it's alright
Breakdown
Takedown
You're busted
This is a town where everyone is reachin' for the top
This is a place where second best will never do
It's okay to want to shine
But once you step across that line
No matter where you hide I'm comin' after you
Shakedown
