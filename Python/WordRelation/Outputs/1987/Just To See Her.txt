Just to see her
Just to touch her
Just to hold her in my arms again one more time
If I could feel her warm embrace
See her smiling face
Can't find anyone to take her place
I've got to see her again
I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again
I can't hide it
I can't fight it
It's so hard to live without the love she gave to me
Doesn't she know it
I tried hard not to show it
Can't I make her realize that she really needs me again
I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again
She brightened up my everyday
Made me feel so good in every way
If I could have her back to stay
I've got to see her again
just to see
i want to see her
just to hold her
hold her hold her hold her
just to see her
see her
just to touch her
touch her
I would do anything
I would go anywhere
There's nothing I wouldn't do
Just to see her again
She brightened up my everyday
Made me feel so good in every way
If I could have her back to stay
I've got to see her again
just to see her
it would it would it would
just to see her
Make me feel so good
just to see her
if i if i could only see her again
just see her again
just to see her
theres nothin' i wouldn't do
just to see her
oh don't you know its true
if i could only
see her again oh...
