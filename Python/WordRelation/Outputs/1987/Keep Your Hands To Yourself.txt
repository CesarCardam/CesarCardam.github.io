35. Georgia Satellites album
I got a little change in my pocket goin' jing-a-ling-a-ling
Wants to call you on the telephone baby, a-give you a ring
But each time we talk, I get the same old thing
Always no hug-ee no kiss-ee until I get a weddin' ring
My honey my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself
B-B-B-baby baby baby why you wan' treat me this way
You know I'm still your lover boy I still feel the same way
That's when she told me a story, 'bout free milk and a cow
And said no hug-ee no kiss-ee until I get a weddin' vow
My honey my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself
(Go man go)
Hold it here
See I wanted her real bad, and I was about to give in
But that's when she started talking about true love,
Started talking about sin
And I said, honey I'll live with you for the rest of my life,
She said no hug-ee no kiss-ee until you make me your wife-a
My honey my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself
