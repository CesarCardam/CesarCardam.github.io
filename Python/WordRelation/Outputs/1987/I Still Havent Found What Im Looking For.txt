I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in the fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
I believe in the Kingdom come
Then all the colors will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes I'm still running
You broke the bonds and you
You loosened the chains
You carried the cross
Of my shame
Oh my shame
You know I believe it
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
