Things we say every day
Come home from work late again
Work so hard and never play
I can't wait to take you far away
Don't you know (don't you know)
Gotta go (gotta go)
Rest your wheels
From everyone every day
Get away (get away)
Go my way (go my way)
When the day begins
To enter your mind
Come go with me
Make you feel like
It's everlasting
Lasting through the time
Come go with me
Have no fears
Bring back the memories
I can't take away the misery
Take my hand, fly away
To a world that
We can find today
Can you feel (can you feel)
I'm for real (I'm for real)
Can I hold you by the
Start in the night
Is it right (is it right)
Hold me tight (hold me tight)
When you look into
My eyes in the light
Come go with me
Make you feel like
It's everlasting
Lasting through the time
(Come go with me)
Come go with me
Have no fears
Two hearts in one
Eternal to the night
Don't worry bout tomorrow
Just come go with me
Don't let it end in sorrow
Love is our destiny
(Come go with me)
(Come go with me)
I'll take you by the hand
We'll find another land
(Come go with me)
(Come go with me)
I'll leave the world behind
The world goes nine to five
Come go with me
Come go with me
(Come go with me, yeah)
Come go with me
Make you feel like
It's everlasting
Lasting through the time
(Into the night)
Come go with me
(Into the night)
Have no fears
(Into the night)
Two hearts in one
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Eternal to the night
Come go with me
(Make away with me tonight)
Make you feel like
(Stay with me tonight)
It's everlasting
(Give, give, give, give)
Lasting through the time
(Give your love)
Come go with me
(Give, give, give, give)
Have no fears
(Give your love)
Two hearts in one
Eternal to the night
Come go with me
(Make away with me tonight)
Make you feel like
(Stay with me tonight)
It's everlasting
(Give, give, give, give)
Lasting through the time
(Give your love)
Come go with me
