68. GenesisInvisible Touch
I'm coming down
Coming down like a monkey
But it's all right
It's like a load on your back
That you can't see
Oh but it's all right
Try to shake it loose, cut it free
Let it go
Just get it away from me
''cause tonight, tonight, tonight
I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I'm going down
Going down like a monkey
But it's all right
It's like a helter skelter
Going down and down
Round and round
But just get it away from me
Because tonight, tonight, tonight
We're gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I've got some money in my pocket
I don't remember where I got it
I gotta give it to you
So please answer the phone
'Cause I keep calling
But you're never home
What am I gonna do
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight
You keep telling me I've got everything
You say I've got everything I want
You keep telling me you're gonna help me
You're gonna help me but you don't
But now I'm in too deep
It's got me so that I just can't sleep
Get me out of here
Please get me out of here
Just help me I'll do anything
Anything if you'll just help
Get me out of here
I'm coming down
Coming down like a monkey
But it's all right
Like a load on your back
That you can't see
But it's all right
Try to shake it loose, cut it free
Let it go
But just get it away from me
'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight
May be we'll make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Please get me out of here
Someone get me out of here
Just help me I'll do anything
Anything if you'll just help
Get me out of here
Tonight I'm gonna make it right
Tonight, tonight, tonight
