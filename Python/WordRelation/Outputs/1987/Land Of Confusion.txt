40. Genesis Invisible Touch
I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street.
Now did you read the news today
They say the dangers gone away
But I can see the fires still alight
There burning into the night.
There's too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Just tell me why
This is a land of confusion.
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and lets start trying
To make it a place worth living in.
Ooh superman where are you now
When everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour.
This is the time
This is the place
Where we look for the future
And there's not much love to go round
Tell me why, this is a land of confusion.
This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and lets start trying
To make it a place worth living in.
I remember long ago
When the sun was shining
Ooh and the stars were bright
All through the night
And the sound of your laughter
As I held you tight
So long ago
I wont be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
Were not just making promises
That we know, well never keep.
Too many men
There's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Just tell me why
This is a land of confusion.
Now this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and lets start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for.
This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and lets start showing
Just where our lives are going to.
