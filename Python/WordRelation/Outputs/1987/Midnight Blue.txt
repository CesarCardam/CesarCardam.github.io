82. Lou GrammReady or Not
Ain't got no regrets
And I ain't losin' track
Of which way I'm going
Ain't gonna double back
Don't want no misplay
Put on no display
An angel? no!
But I know my way
I used follow
Yeah, that's true
But my following days are over
Now I just gotta follow through
I remember what my father said
He said "Son, life is simple"
It's either cherry red or
Midnight blue
Oh midnight blue, oh
You were the restless one
And you did not care
That I was the trouble boy
Lookin' for a double dare
I won't apologize for
The things I've done and said
But when I win your heart,
I'm gonna paint it cherry red
I don't want to talk about it
What you do to me
I can't live without it
And you might think that
It's much too soon
For us to go this far into the
Midnight blue
Oh midnight blue, oh
You were the restless one
And you did not care
That I was the trouble boy
Lookin' for a double dare
Things could be different
But that'd be a shame, 'cause
I'm the one who could feel the sun
Right in the pouring rain
I won't say where And I don't know when
But soon there's gonna come a day
I'll be back again
Yeah, I'll be back for you
You see, I'm saving up my love
Midnight blue
Oh midnight blue, oh
You were the restless one
And you did not care
That I was the trouble boy
Lookin' for a double dare
