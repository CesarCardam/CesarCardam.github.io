I can't read about it, burns the skin from your eyes
I'll do fine without it, here's one you don't compromise
Lies come hard to disguise
Let me to fight it out, not wild about it
Lay your seedy judgements, who says they're part of our lives?
You own the money, you control the witness
I hear you're lonely, don't monkey with my business
You pay the profits to justify the reasons
I heard your promise but I don't believe it
That's why I'll do it again
No-no-notorious
Girls will keep the secrets, so long as boys make the noise
Fools run rings to break up, something they'll never destroy
Grand notorious slam, (bam) and who really gives a damn
For a flaky bandit?
Don't ask me to bleed about it, I need this blood to survive
You own the money, you control the witness
I hear you're lonely, don't monkey with my business
You pay the profits to justify the reasons
I heard your promise but I don't believe it
That's why I'll do it again
