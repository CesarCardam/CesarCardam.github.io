72. Gloria Estefan & Miami Sound MachineGloria Estefan - Greatest Hits
At night when you turn off all the lights
There's no place that you can hide
No no, the rhythm is gonna get'cha
In bed, throw the covers on your head
You pretend like you are dead
But I know it, the rhythm is gonna gey'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get you
The rhythm is gonna get you tonight
No way, you can fight it every day
But no matter what you say
You know it the rhythm is gonna get'cha
No clue, of what's happening to you
And before this night is through
Ooh baby the rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get you
The rhythm is gonna get you tonight
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get you
The rhythm is gonna get you
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
(Na na na na na na na na)
The rhythm is gonna get you
(Na na na na na na na na)
Rhythm is gonna get'cha (na na na na na na na na)
Rhythm is gonna get'cha (na na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na na na na na)
The rhythm is gonna get you tonight!
