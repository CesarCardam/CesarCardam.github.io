While there is time
Let's go out and feel everything
If you hold me
I will let you into my dreams
For time is a river rolling into nowhere
We must live while we can
And we'll drink our cup of laughter
The finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be
I've been sad
And have walked bitter streets alone
And come morning
There's a good wind to blow me home
So time be a river rolling into nowhere
I will live while I can
I will have my ever after
The finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be
We go so fast, why don't we make it last
Life is glowing inside you and me
Please take my hand, right here where I stand
Won't you come out and dance with me, oh
Come see
And lovers try
'Til they get the best of the night
And come morning
They are tangled up in the light
So time be a river rolling into nowhere
And they love while they can
And they think about the night so sweet
The finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be
The finer things keep shining through
The way my soul gets lost in you
The finer things I feel in me
The golden dance life could be
