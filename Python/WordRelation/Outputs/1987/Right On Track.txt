94. Breakfast Clubalbum
Gonna make a move that knocks you over
Watch this turn one's gonna put you away
But I'm doing my very best dancing
Every time you're looking the other way
I could move out to the left for a while
I could slide to the right for a while
I could get up and back
Right on track
But is right on track
Is that gonna get you back
I've been trying to get your attention
And I'm very, very close to thinking of a way
I could be big and tough and other funny stuff
But you just keep looking the other way
How far away can you go
And still be dancing with me
Would you mind staying in the vicinity
I've not been faring badly
But I would gladly take you back
There must be some kind of bad connection
'Cause this music does not sound the way it did
I got to get up and back 'cause I've been off track
And that may be just why you disappeared
But now I've got you in the corner
