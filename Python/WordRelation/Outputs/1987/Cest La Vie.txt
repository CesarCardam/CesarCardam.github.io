06. Robbie Nevil album
Got a job
That's okay
But they've got me workin' night and day.
Punchin' in
Punchin' out
Is this really what life's all about?
What you are gonna do
What you are gonna feel? I don't know.
What you ore gonna feel
What you are gonna do?
Won't someone tell me?
What yov want to say
What you want to do
There's only one thing left to say.
What you want to do
What you want to say.
See'est la vie
See'est la vie -
That's iust the way it goes - That's right!
See'est la vie
See'est la vie -
That's iust the way it goes - That's right!
Baby's gone all alone
Are you sad because you're on your own?
Get back up
Party down
There's so many good ones still around.
What you are gonna do
What you are gonna feel? I don't know.
What you are gonna feel
What you are gonna do?
Won't someone tell me?
What you want to say
What you want to do
I guess there's just one thing to say.
See'est la vie
See'est la vie -
That's iust the way it goes - That's right!
Hey
It's J.J.
What you been doin'?
You say your car broke down
The thing just isn't movin'.
Say J.J.
Don't you know when you're down
There's just one way to go
And that's singin'
See'est la vie
See'est la vie -
That's iust the way it goes - That's right!
See'est la vie
See'est la vie -
That's iust the way it goes - That's right!
See'est la vie
See'est la vie -
That's iust the way it goes - That's right!
