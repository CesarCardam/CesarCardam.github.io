12. Wang Chung album
I'll drive a million miles
To be with you tonight
So if you're feeling low
Turn up your radio
The words we use are strong
They make reality
But now the music's on
Oh baby dance with me yeah
Rip it up
Move down
Rip it up
Move it down to the ground
Rip it up
Cool down
Rip it up
And get the feeling not the word
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun
Deep in the world tonight
Our hearts beat safe and sound
I'll hold you so close
Just let yourself go down
Rip it up
Move down
Rip it up
Move it down to the ground
Rip it up
Cool down
Rip it up
Get out what's inside of you
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun
On the edge of oblivion
All the world is Babylon
And all the love and ev'ryone
A ship of fools sailing on
(Everybody)
Everybody have fun tonight
(Everybody)
Everybody have fun tonight
Across the nation
Around the world
Everybody have fun tonight
A celebration so spread the word
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody Wang Chung tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun
Everybody
Everyone
