70. ABCAbsolutely
Debonair lullabies in melodies revealed
In deep despair or lonely nights
He knows just how you feel
The slyest rhymes, the sharpest suits
In miracles made real
Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And every thing's good in the world tonight
When smokey sings, I hear violins
When smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
The front door might slam
But the back door it rings
And smokey sings, he sings
Elegance in eloquence for sale or rent or hire
Should I say yes, I match his best
Then I would be a liar
Symphonies soothe the rage
When lovers hearts catch fire
Like a bird in flight on a hot sweet night
You know you're right just to hold her tight
He soothes it right, makes it out of sight
And every thing's good in the world tonight
When smokey sings, I hear violins
When smokey sings, I forget everything, yeah
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
Smashing the hell
With the heaven she brings
Then smokey sings, he sings
(But if he couldn't sing)
Luther croons
Sly's the original, originator
James screams
Marvin was the only innovator
But nothing can compare, nothing can compare
When smokey sings
When smokey sings, I hear violins
When smokey sings, I forget everything
As she's packing her things
As she's spreading her wings
She threw back the ring
When smokey sings
Smokey sings
Smokey sings
