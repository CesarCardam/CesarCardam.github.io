39. Prince The Hits 2
Here we are folks
The dream we all dream of
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Tell me, have you got the look?
You walked in, I woke up
I've never seen a pretty girl
Look so tough, baby
You got that look
Color you peach and black
Color me takin' aback
Crucial, I think I want ya
You've got the look (You've got the hook)
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good
Let's get to rammin'
You got the look
You got the look
Look here
You got the look (you got the look)
You must'a took (you must'a took)
A whole hour just to make up your face, baby
Closin' time, ugly lights, everybody's inspected (Everybody's inspected)
But you are a natural beauty unaffected (Unaffected)
Did I say an hour?
My face is red, I stand corrected (I stand corrected)
You've got the look
You've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good
Let's get to rammin'
You got the look
You got the look
(There's no girl to do)
Well here we are, ladies and gentlemen, the dream we all dream of
(Oh, please!) Boy versus girl in the World Series of love slammin'
You walked in (I walked in)
I woke up (you woke up)
I never seen such a pretty girl look so tough
(I never seen such a pretty girl look so tough)
Baby (Baby)
You got that look (you got that look)
Yes you do (Yes you do)
Color you peach and black
Color me takin' aback, baby
Crucial, I think I want ya
You've got the look
You've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If your love is good
Let's get to rammin' (Now)
You got the look
You got the look
Here we are folks
The dream we all dream of
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look
