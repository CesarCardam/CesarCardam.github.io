Breakout
Breakout
When explanations make no sense,
When every answer's wrong,
You're fighting with lost confidence,
All expectations gone.
The time has come to make or break;
Move on, don't hesitate.
Breakout, don't stop to ask;
Now you've found a break to make it last.
You've got to find a way,
Say what you want to say; breakout.
When situations never change,
Tomorrow looks unsure,
Don't leave your destiny to chance.
What are you waiting for?
The time has come to make or break.
Breakout, don't stop to ask;
Now you've found a break to make it last.
You've got to find a way,
Say what you want to say; breakout.
Breakout, don't stop to ask;
Now you've found a break to make it last.
You've got to find a way,
Say what you want to say; breakout.
Some people stop at nothing.
If you're searching for something,
Lay down the law, shout out for more.
Breakout and shout day in and day out;
Breakout, don't stop to ask'
Now you've found a break to make it last.
You've got to find a way,
Say what you want to say; breakout.
Don't stop to ask;
Now you've found a break to make it last.
You've got to find a way,
Say what you want to say; breakout.
Don't stop to ask;
Now you've found a break to make it last.
You've got to find a way,
Say what you want to say; breakout.
