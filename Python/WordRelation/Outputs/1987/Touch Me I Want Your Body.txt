44. Samantha Fox album
Ah, touch me
(This is the night) Ah, touch me
I want to feel your body
Ah
Ah
Full moon in the city and the night was young
I was hungry for love, I was hungry for fun
I was hunting you down, and I was the bait
When I saw you there, I didn't need to hesitate
This is the night
This is the night
This is the time, we've got to get it right
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me now
Quick as a flash you disappeared into the night
Did I hurt you boy
Didn't I treat you right
You made me feel so good, made me feel myself
Now I'm alone and you're with somebody else
This is the night
This is the night
This is the time, we've got to get it right
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me now
Touch me, touch me now
Touch me, touch me now
Hot and cold emotion, confusing my brain
I could not decide, between pleasure and pain
Like a tramp in the night, I was begging for you
To treat my body like you wanted to
Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh
Oh, I was begging for you
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine
(This is the night)
'Cause I want your body
All the time
Ah, touch me, touch me, touch me
(This is the night)
Touch me, touch me
I want to feel your body
(This is the night)
I want to feel your body
(This is the night)
