14. Atlantic Starr album
Girl you are to me, all that a woman should be
And I dedicate my life to you always
The love like yours is grand
It must have been sent from up above
And I know you'll stay this way, for always
And we both know, that our love will grow
And forever it will be you and me
Ooh your life is sun
Chasing all the rain away
When you come around you bring a brighter day
You're the perfect one
For me and you forever we'll be
And I will love you so for always
Come with me my sweet
Let's go make a family
And they will bring us joy, for always
Oh boy I love your soul
I can't find enough ways to let you know
But you can be sure of course, for always
And we both know, that our love will grow
And forever it will be you and me
Ooh your life is sun
Chasing all the rain away
When you come around you bring a brighter day
You're the perfect one
For me and you forever we'll be
And I will love you so for always
Oh you're like the sun chasing all of the rain away
Oh boy I love you so
And you can be sure I'm yours for always
When you come around you bring brighter days
Come with me my sweet
For me and you forever will be
A love like yours is rare
I will love you so, for always
