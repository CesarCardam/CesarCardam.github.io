13. Smokey Robinson My World: The Definitive Collection
Cruise
Baby let's cruise, away from here
Don't be confused, the way is clear
And if you want it you got it forever
This is not a one night stand
Let the music take your mind
Ooh just release and you will find
You're gonna fly away, glad your goin' my way
I love it when we're cruising together
The music is played for love,
Cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruising together
Baby tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
To every little part of each other
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find
You're gonna fly away, glad your goin' my way
I love it when we're cruising together
Music is played for love,
Cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruising together
Cruise with me baby
Cruise with me baby
So good
Baby lets cruise
Lets float, lets glide
Ooh lets open up and go inside
And if you want it you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you
And love you baby,
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find
You're gonna fly away, glad your goin' my way
I love it when we're cruising together
Music is played for love,
Cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruising together
You're gonna fly away, glad your goin' my way
I love it when we're cruising together
Music is played for love,
Cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruising together
You're gonna fly away, glad your goin' my way
I love it when we're cruising together
The music is played for love,
Cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruising together
You're gonna fly away, glad your goin' my way
I love it when we're cruising together
Music is played for love,
Cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruising together
