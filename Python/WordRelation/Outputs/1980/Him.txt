50. Rupert Holmes album
Over by the window, there's a pack of cigarettes.
Not my brand you understand,
Sometimes the girl forgets
She forgets to hide them
I know who left those smokes behind
She'll say, oh, he's just a friend,
And I'll say, oh, I'm not blind
To..
[Chorus]
Him him him, what's she gonna do about him?
She's gonna have to live without him,
It's him or it's me, me me,
No one gets to get it for free
It's me or it's him.
Don't know what he looks like,
Don't know who he is.
Don't know why she thought that I
Would say what's mine is his.
I don't want to own her,
But I can't let her have it both ways.
Three is one too many of us,
She leaves with me or stays
With..
[Chorus]
If she wants him she can have him,
Just exactly how we once were,
Its goodbye to he and I,
and back to me and her,
Without..
[Chorus]
[Chorus]
