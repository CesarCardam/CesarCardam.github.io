98. Barry Manilow Ultimate Manilow
We walked to the sea, just my father 'n' me
And the dogs played around on the sand
Winter cold cut the air, hangin' still ev'rywhere
Dressed in gray, did he say hold my hand
I said love's easier when it's far away
We sat 'n watched a distant light
We're two ships that pass in the night
We both smile and we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night
There's a boat on the line where the sea meets the sky
There's another that rides far behind
And it seems you and I are like strangers a wide ways apart
As we drift on through time
He said it's harder now we're far away
We only read you when you write
We're two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night
We're ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night
We're ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
