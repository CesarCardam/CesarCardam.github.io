49. Dr. Hook Timeless
I'm your friend, you can talk to me
I read your face, I see misery
So the one you love has left you dry
Don't start believing that you're gonna die
Just pick your heart up off the floor
And try, try again
You'll find better love next time, baby
Don't give up and I know you're gonna find
Better love next time, baby
Someone will be waiting down the line
With better love, better love, better love, better love next time
Sometimes it's better to let it all go
I've been there and I think I should know
So have a good cry, wash out your heart
If you keep it inside it'll tear you apart
Sometimes you lose but you're gonna win
If you just, if you just keep hanging in
You'll find better love next time, baby
Don't give up and I know you're gonna find
Better love next time, baby
Someone will be waiting down the line
With better love, better love, better love, better love next time
You'll find better love next time, baby
Don't give up and I know you're gonna find
Better love next time, baby
Someone will be waiting down the line
With better love, better love, better love, better love next time
Better love next time, baby
Don't give up
