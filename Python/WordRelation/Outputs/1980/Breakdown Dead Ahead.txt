I call ya...
You ain't in
What's this cold reaction
Where've you been
Ooh, baby, let it on the line
This is last call, you say that's all
You can take it fine
I'm sorry but...
It don't make sense
You're pullin' just right out on first offense
Ooh, baby, play it smart
For you go south with your big mouth
Let it take your heart...
Danger, there's a breakdown dead ahead
Maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn, might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down...
I told ya
No more lyin'
No more tears fallin'
Stop your cryin'
Ooh, baby, I'm your fan
Before you go back to your side track
Baby understand...
Danger there's a breakdown dead ahead
Just maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn, might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no...
Danger, there's a breakdown dead ahead
Then just maybe you're in way above your head
I may burn, might upset you
But you know I'd never let you down, down, down, down...
No, no, no...
