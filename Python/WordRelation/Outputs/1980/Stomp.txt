48. Brothers Johnson Light Up the Night
Steppin' out the weekends open wide
Fill it up let's blast the jams and ride
While we're cruisin' around in the street
Listen up for the party in feet
Slap me five
that's the place we've arrived
It's alive
Ev'rybody take it to the top
We're gonna stomp
All night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel alright
Gonna stomp
All night
Wanna party
'Til the morning light
Runnin' runnin' runnin'
The set is hot
There's people wall to wall
Old gones young things
Short ones standing tall
Grab the one with the smile on her face
And hit the floor and stay right on the case
The heat is on
And the funk just won't leave us alone
Ev'rybody take it to the top
We're gonna Stomp
All night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right
Gonna stomp
All night
Wanna party
'Til the morning light
Gonna Stomp
All night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right
Gonna stomp
All night
Wanna party
'Til the morning light
STOMP
Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp you don't want to quit
Put your heels where you're feelin' it
Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp you don't want to quit
Put your heels where you're feelin' it
Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp you don't want to quit
Put your heels where you're feelin' it
[Instrumental Interlude]
Gonna Stomp
All night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right
Gonna stomp
All night
Wanna party
'Til the morning light
Stomp
All night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right
Gonna stomp
All night
Wanna party
'Til the morning light.....
