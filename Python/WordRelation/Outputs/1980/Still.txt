Lady
Morning's just a moment away
And I'm without you once again
You laughed at me
You said you've never needed me
I wonder if you need me now
So many dreams that flew away
So many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go?
Where'd we go, we lost what we both had found
You know we let each other down
But then most of all, I do love you
Still
We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me
'Cause I needed you so desperately
We were too blind to see
But then most of all, I do love you
Still
