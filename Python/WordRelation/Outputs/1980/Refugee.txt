100. Tom Petty & The HeartbreakersIn the Coliseum
We got some thin' we both know it,
We don't talk too much about it
Ain't no real big secret, all the same,
Somehow we get around it
Listen, it don't really matter to me
Baby, you believe what you want to believe
You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
Somewhere, somehow, somebody must have
Kicked you around some
Tell me why you want to lay there,
Revel in your abandon
Honey, it don't make no difference to me
Baby, everybody's had to fight to be free
You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
No baby, you don't have to live like a refugee
Baby, we ain't the first
I'm sure a lot of other lovers been burned
Right now this ain't real to you
It's one of those things you got to feel to be true
Somewhere, somehow, somebody must have
Kicked you around some
Who knows, maybe you were kidnapped,
Tied-up, taken away, and held for ransom
Honey, it don't really matter to me
Baby, everybody's ha d to fight to be free
You see, you don't have to live like a refugee
No, you don't have to live like a refugee
Baby, you don't have to live like a refugee
