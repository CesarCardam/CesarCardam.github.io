26. Robbie Dupree album
c'mon and hold me, Just like you told me
Then show me... What I want to know
CHORUS:
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away Into the night
I know it ain't right
Tease me, Why don't you please me
Then show me, What you came here for
CHORUS
Into the night, babe
Baby tonight...Make it tonight
Ooohhhh...
I caught you glancing my way
And I know what you're after (...no second chances tonight)
Why...don't we steal away (repeat 3 times)
Into the night
I know it ain't right, Into the night
I know it ain't right, Why don't we steal away
I know it ain't right, Into the night, babe
Why don't we steal away, Make it tonight
Why don't we steal away...
