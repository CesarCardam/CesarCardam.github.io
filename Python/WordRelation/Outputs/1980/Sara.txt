87. Fleetwood Mac The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac
Wait a minute baby
Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me about the fire
Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me home
