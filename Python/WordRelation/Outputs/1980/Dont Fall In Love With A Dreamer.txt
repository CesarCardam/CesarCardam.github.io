31. Kenny Rogers & Kim Carnes Greatest Hits
Just look at you sitting there
You never looked better than tonight
And it'd be so easy to tell ya I'd stay
Like I've done so many times
I was so sure this would be the night
You'd close the door and want to stay with me
And it'd be so easy to tell ya I'll stay
Like I've done so many times
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every time
Oh, put out the light, just hold on
Before we say goodbye
Now it's mornin' and the phone rings
And you say you've gotta get your things together
You just gotta leave before ya change your mind
And if ya knew what I was thinkin', girl
I'd turn around if you'd just ask me one more time
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every time
Oh, put out the light, just hold on
Before we say goodbye
Before we say goodbye
Goodbye
