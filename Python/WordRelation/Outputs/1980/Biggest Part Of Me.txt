27. Ambrosia album
(Sunlight) There's a new sun arisin'
(In your eyes) I can see a new horizon
(Realize) That will keep me realizin'
You're the biggest part of me
(Stay the night) Need your lovin' here beside me
(Shine the light) Need it close enough to guide me
(All my life) I've been hoppin' you would find me
You're the biggest part of me
Well, make a wish, baby
And I will make it come true
Make a list baby, of the things I'll do for you
Ain't no risk in lettin' my love rain down on you
So we can wash away the past so that we may start anew
(Rainbow) Risin' over my shoulder
(Love flows) Gettin' better as we're older
(All I know) All I wanna do is hold her
She's the life that breathes in me
(Forever) Got a feelin' that forever
Together) We are gonna stay together
(Forever) For me there's nothing better
You're the biggest part of me
Well, make a wish, baby
And I will make it come true
Make a list baby, of the things I'll do for you
Ain't no risk in lettin' my love rain down on you
So we can wash away the past so that we may start anew
More than an easy feelin'
She brings joy to me
How can I tell you what it means to me
Flow like a lazy river
For an eternity
I finally found someone who believes in me
And I'll never leave
(Now I've found all I need)
(Beside me) Need your lovin' here beside me
(To guide me) Keep it close enough to guide me
(Inside of me) From the fears that are inside of me
You're the biggest part of me
(Forever) Got a feelin' that forever
(Together) We are gonna stay together
(Forever) From now until forever
You're the biggest part or me
You're the life that breathes in me
You're the biggest part of me
You changed my life
You made it bright
And I'll be a savior to you
For the rest of my life
Oh, the biggest part of me
