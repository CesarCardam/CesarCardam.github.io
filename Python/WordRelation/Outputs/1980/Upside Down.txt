18. Diana Ross Life &amp; Love: The Very Best Of Diana Ross
I said upside down
You're turning me
You're giving love instinctively
Around and round you're turning me
Upside down
Boy, you turn me
Inside out
And round and round
Upside down
Boy, you turn me
Inside out
And round and round
Instinctively you give to me
The love that i need
I cherish the moments with you
Respectfully i see to thee
I'm aware that you're cheating
When no one makes me feel like you do
Upside down
Boy, you turn me
Inside out
And round and round
Upside down
Boy, you turn me
Inside out
And round and round
I know you got charm and appeal
You always play the field
I'm crazy you are mine
As long as the sun continues to shine
There's a place in my heart for you
That's the bottomline
Upside down
Boy, you turn me
Inside out
And round and round
Upside down
Boy, you turn me
Inside out
And round and round
Instinctively you give to me
The love that i need
I cherish the moments with you

But no one makes me feel like you do
Upside down
