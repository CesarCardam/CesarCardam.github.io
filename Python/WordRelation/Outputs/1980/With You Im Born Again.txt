21. Billy Preston & Syreeta album
Come bring me your softness.
Comfort me through all this madness.
Woman, don't you know with you I'm born again?
Come give me your sweetness.
Now there's you, there is no weakness.
Woman, don't you know with you I'm born again?
I was half not whole, in step with none.
Reaching through this world, in need of one.
Come show me your kindness.
In your arms I now I'll find this.
Woman, don't you know with you I'm born again?
Lying safe with you I'm born again.
Come bring me your softness.
Comfort me through all this madness.
Lying safe within your arms, I'm born again.
Come give me your sweetness.
Now there's you, there is no weakness.
Lying safe within your arms, I'm born again.
I was half not whole, in step with none.
Reaching through this world, in need of one.
Come show me your kindness.
In your arms I now I'll find this.
Lying safe within your arms, I'm born again.
Lying safe with you I'm born again.
