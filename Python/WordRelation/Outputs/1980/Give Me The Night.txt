91. George Benson Give Me the Night
Whenever dark has fallen
You know the spirit of the party
Starts to come alive.
Until the day is dawning
You can throw out all your blues
And hit the city lights.
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of loving everywhere
So gimme the night. Gimme the night.
You need the evening action,
A place to dine, a glass of wine,
A little late romance.
It's a chain reaction.
You'll see the people of the world
Coming out to dance.
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of loving everywhere
So gimme the night. Gimme the night.
So come on out tonight
And we'll lead the others
On a ride through paradise.
And if you feel all right
Then we can be lovers 'cause I see that
Starlight look in your eyes.
Don't you know we can fly?
Just gimme the night. Gimme the night.
And if we stay together,
We'll feel the rhythm of the evening
Taking us up high.
Never mind the weather.
We'll be dancing in the street
Until the morning light.
'Cause there's music in the air
And lots of loving everywhere.
So gimme the night. Gimme the night
