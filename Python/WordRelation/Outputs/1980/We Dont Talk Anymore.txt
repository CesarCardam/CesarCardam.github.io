Used to think that life was sweet.
Used to think we were so complete.
I can't believe you'd throw it away.
Used to feel we had it made.
Used to feel we could sail away.
Can you imagine how I feel today.
Well it seems a long time ago you were the lonely one.
Now it comes to letting go you are the only one.
Do you know what you've done.
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore.
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore.
But I ain't losing sleep and I ain't counting sheep.
it's so funny how we don't talk anymore.
Well it really doesn't matter to me.
I guess you're leaving was meant to be.
It's down to you now you want to be free.
Well I hope you know which way to go you're on your own again.
And don't come crying to me when you're the lonely one.
Remember what you've done.
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore.
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore
But I ain't losing sleep and I ain't counting sheep.
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore.
But I ain't losing sleep and I ain't counting sheep.
It's so funny how we don't talk.
But I ain't losing sleep and I ain't counting sheep.
It's so funny how we don't talk.
