25. Dr. Hook Timeless
I was sittin' all alone
Watching people get it on with each other
They were dancing 'cross the floor
Turning, moving back and forth, they were lovers
One more lonely night for me
I looked up, what did I see?
Sexy eyes moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, gettin' down with you
I wanna move with you sexy eyes
I got up and took your hand
And we both began to dance to the music
Ooh, your magic cast a spell
It didn't take long till we fell and we knew it
No more lonely nights for me
This is how it's gonna be
Sexy eyes moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, gettin' down with you
I wanna move with you sexy eyes
No more lonely nights for me
This is how it's gonna be
Sexy eyes moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, gettin' down with you
I wanna groove with you sexy eyes
Sexy eyes moving 'cross the floor
Got me wanting more sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, gettin' down with you
I wanna groove with you sexy eyes
