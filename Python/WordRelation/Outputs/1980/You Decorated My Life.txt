93. Kenny Rogers Greatest Hits
All my life was a paper
Once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen, changin' moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music
Every note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face
And you decorated my life
Created a world
Where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life
By paintin' your love all over my heart
You decorated my life
Like a rhyme with no reason
In an unfinished song
There was no harmony, life meant nothin' to me until you came along
And you brought out the colors
What a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be, shinin' soft in your eyes
And you decorated my life
Created a world
Where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life
By paintin' your love
All over my heart
You decorated my life
