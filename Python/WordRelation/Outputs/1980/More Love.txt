Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Let it be soon, don't hesitate, make love, don't wait.
Open your heart and let my love come in.
I want the moment to start when I can fill your heart
with more love and more joy than age or time could ever destroy.
Oh honey now, my love will be so sound,
gonna take about a hundred lifetimes to live it down,
wear it down, tear it down.
This is no fiction, this no act,
This is real, it's a fact.
I'll always belong only to you.
And each day I'll be living to
Make sure I'm giving you more love and more joy
than age or time could ever destroy.
Oh honey now, my love will be so sound,
gonna take about a hundred lifetimes to live it down,
wear it down, tear it down.
As we grow older, no need to fear,
'Cause when you need me I'll be here.
I'll be beside you every step of the way.
A heart that's truthful, and is keeping it youthful
With more love and more joy than age or time could ever destroy.
Oh honey now, my love will be so sound,
gonna take about a hundred lifetimes to live it down,
wear it down, tear it down.
Oh I'm gonna give you
more love and more joy than age or time could ever destroy.
Oh honey now, my love will be so sound,
gonna take about a hundred lifetimes to live it down,
wear it down, tear it down.
