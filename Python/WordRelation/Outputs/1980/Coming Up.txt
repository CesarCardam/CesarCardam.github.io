You want a love to last forever
One that will never fade away
I want to help you with your problem
Stick around, I say
It's coming up, it's coming up
Coming up (like a flower)
Coming up (yeah)
You want a friend you can rely on
One who will never fade away
I know you're searching for an answer
Stick around, I say
It's coming up, it's coming up
Coming up (only hour)
Coming up (yeah)
You want a better kind of future
One that everyone can share
You're not alone, we all could use it
Stick around we're nearly there
It's coming up, it's coming up
Coming up (like a flower)
Coming up
You want a love to last forever
One that will never fade away
