61. Mc Lytealbum
To the L, to the Y and the T to the E
So get ready cause I want everybody to say this with me
[Chorus]
Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood
Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I'll get my bodyguard, You'll get that booty scarred,
I'm a veteran which means that I've been
In the game too long Since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I float like a butterfly sting like a bee,
Spectacular on the M I C,
I go for broke, Never giving it less than the best
Many years in the game at your request,
You like the rhyme bite if you dare,
I get the paper so I don't care,
Fly that's me the epitome
Of what a real MC is supposed to be,
Fucking you up every time that I drop,
Fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the best and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I
Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood
Would you back off me and let my skin breathe,
Lyte is everlasting it's hard to believe
I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, don't plan to get down.
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun,
If you don't understand just say you don't(nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best,
West to East See East to West,
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive.
It's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics,
I got many witnesses who can back this
Ruffnecks from New York to LA
Been down with me since Poor Georgie.
It's '96, it's all about show and prove
And I'm about to make the ill type moves,
I guide the beat and ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I
Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood
Would you get out my shit, please let me be,
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that,
Trying to get over like a fat rat,
But I understand, I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop,
It goes on, on, on, on
You see the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver,
Chillin with a pina colada,
Kidada hooked me up with Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, Don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit
Done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you
You betta get down with your real crew,
Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I
Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood
To the L, to the Y, and the T, to the E
Rock a party and rock a party and rock a
Party int the B- girl stance.
