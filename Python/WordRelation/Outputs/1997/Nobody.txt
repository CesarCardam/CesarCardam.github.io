I wanna tease you, I wanna please you
I wanna show you baby, that I need you
I want your body, 'til the very last drop
I want you to holler, when you want me to stop
And who can love you like me? (Nobody)
Who can sex you like me? (Nobody)
Who can treat you like me, my baby?(Nobody)
Nobody baby (nobody)
And who can do it like me? (Nobody)
Who can give you what you need? (Nobody)
Who can do you all night long? (Nobody)
Nobody baby (Nobody)
I want the night for me and you
So come here, baby, and let me do it to you
Don't be afraid, 'cause I won't bite
I promise to give it to you just the way you like
And who can love you like me? (Nobody)
Who can sex you like me? (Nobody)
And who can lay your body down? (Nobody)
Nobody baby (Nobody)
And who can treat you like me? (Nobody)
Who can give you what you need? (Nobody)
And who can do you all night long? (Nobody)
Nobody baby (Nobody)
