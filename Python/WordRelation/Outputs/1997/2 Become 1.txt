Candle light and soul forever
A dream of you and me together
Say you believe it, say you believe it
Free your mind of doubt and danger
Be for real don't be a stranger
We can achieve it, we can achieve it
Come a little bit closer baby, get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one
I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be
Silly games that you were playing
Empty words we both were saying
Let's work it out boy, let's work it out boy
Once again if we endevour
Love will bring us back together
Take it or leave it, take it or leave it
Are you as good as I remember baby, get it on, get it on
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one
I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be
Ah, oh wow
Ah, oh wow
Be a little bit wiser baby, put it on, put it on
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one
I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
I need some love like I never needed love before
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
(Wanna make love to ya baby)
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be
It's the only way to be
It's the only way to be
