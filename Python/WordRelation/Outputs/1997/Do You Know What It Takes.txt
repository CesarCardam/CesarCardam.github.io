29. RobynShow Me Love / Do You Know (What It Takes)
Always be around
Don't you know I can see what you do to me
Running around with your cheap talk, cheap talk
What I need is a man who can do me right, do me right
If you got what I need, I can guarantee
To return all the love that you've giving to me
But, I've got to be sure that you always will be around (Always be around)
Do you know what it takes to love me
Do you know what it takes to do me right
Do you know what it takes to love me, baby, baby
Heaven knows in my time, I've been lonely
Feeling my love echo in my mind, in my mind, yeah
Never satisfied girl is what they call me
But I just can't keep going on living lies
Guaranteed, underneath
You won't let me down
There's so much I can give
But it's buried so deep
I just got to be sure that you always will be around (Always be around)
Do you know what it takes to love me (Do you know)
Do you know what it takes to do me right
Do you know what it takes to love me, baby, baby
Do you know what it takes (Do you know)
Do you know what it takes
(Don't waste my time, with your lies)
Yeah baby, I got enough
(You got to prove that you will always be around)
I'll give you everything
Boy will you do the same for me
Will you do anything
I gotta know the way it'll be
Do you know what it takes to love me (Do you know)
Do you know what it takes to do me right
Do you know, do you know, do you know what it takes
Do you know what it takes, do you know what it takes to do me right
(Don't waste my time baby)
