Gotham city for the ghetto ghetto
Gotham city for the ghetto ghetto
Uh yo yo! Everybody's talking
About the good old days
About the good old days
Huh I remember when me and my brothers
We used to sit up on the porch in the
Summertime and just talk about just making it
You know what I'm saying being successful
Following up our dreams you know and I
I believe that's every kids dream
You know what I'm saying to rise and
Be somebody but damn!
Sometimes we just get caught up
I ain't got no money
And I ain't got no friends
Looks like my world is coming to an end
No food on the table, no clothes on my back
No shoes on my feet and
I just bearly got a used Cadillac
Now ain't that ghetto for ya
But somehow it's gotta change yeah
Ghetto for ya
So I took this remix and
Rearranged gotham city
[Chorus]
City of love a city of peace
For everyone of us
'Cause we all need it,
Can't live without it
Gotham city for the ghetto yeah!
Gotham city for the ghetto,
That's what I'm talking 'bout
Ghetto fabulous, to a nigga health be hazardous
If you wanna test raffishness for the respect
S.T.R.I.N.G.S. Yes. (oh yeah)
Fuck the rest give me the best
Why should I have to settle for less
When I could push the V-12's with finesse
(scratching) and all that mess
If you try to hold me back
Would I keep on struggling till I hit the sky.
Even if you wanted to you can't deny
Gotta feed baby girl who would die
We keep talking about escalating
Well who's gonna go first
Guess I'll be the one to step up
If you don't follow me it would be the worst
Every time something goes down
Somebody's crying ghetto tears
Hope I'm not raining on your parade
But this is not what keeping it really is
Now ain't that ghetto for ya
But somehow it's gotta change yeah!
Ghetto for ya,
So I took this remix and rearranged
A gotham city
[Chorus]
Check it out
Now motherfucker wanna act surprised
'Cause you're afraid to change scared to rise
That's why you ass get left behind
They got a sight, they got a mind
'Cause ain't nobody gonna stop the dream
Talk that shit, block my cream
Negativity you gotta let go
Heaven gotta see for the ghetto
We all need hey hey hey
Gotham city for the ghetto yeah
Calling on heaven
Send your love down, to the ghetto yeah
Talking about a land where oh yeah
Where there will be no more crying,
No more crying now oh yeah
A place where we could all just get along yeah
And children will sing ghetto love songs
In a land where (city of love)
In a land where (for every one of us)
