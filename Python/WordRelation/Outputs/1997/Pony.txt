62. GinuwineGinuwine...The Bachelor
I'm just a bachelor
I'm looking for a partner
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even falling off
Gotta be compatible
Takes me to my limits
Girl when I break you off
I promise that you won't want to get off
If you're horny lets do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
If you're horny lets do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
Sitting here flossing
Peepin' your steelo
Just once if I have the chance
The things I would do to you
You and your body
Every single portion
Send chills up and down your spine
Juice flowing down your thigh
If you're horny lets do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
If you're horny lets do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
If we're gonna get nasty baby
First we'll show and tell
Till' I reach your pony tail, oh
Lurk all over and through you baby
Until we reach the stream
You'll be on my jockey team, oh
If you're horny lets do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
If you're horny lets do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
If you're horny lets do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
If you're horny lets do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
If you're horny lets do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waiting, come and jump on it
Ride it, saddles
