I got this feeling and I just can't turn it loose
That somebody's been getting next to you
I don't want to walk around knowin' I was your fool
'Cause being the man that I am
I just can't lose my cool
My friends keep telling me about the things that's going on babe
But deep in my heart baby I hope that I'm wrong
Yes I hope I'm wrong but I know it babe
Somebody's sleeping in my bed my bed baby
Somebody's takin' my place (baby)
Somebody's sleeping in my bed baby
And you know just what I mean, oh oh oh oh oh!
I come home early expecting your warm embrace
But something is wrong 'cause its written all over your face
It hurt so bad when I walked through the door
But 'cha know one damn thing baby I ain't coming back no more
No no no
Now don't try to tell me things are still the same
'Cause when we made love I heard you call out his name, call out his name
Somebody's sleeping in my bed tonight baby
Somebody's takin' my place
Somebody's sleeping in my bed baby
And you know just what I mean
Gave you money and every lil' thing that you need
I gave you the world (yes i did) 'cause you were my girl
But you still ran out on me oh yeah
Said you're sleeping in my bed
Messin' with my head oooh
Tell me why, oh why oh why
Why oh why oh why
Why oh why oh why oh why oh why said you're
Sleeping in my bed
Messin' with my head
