30. Boyz II MenLegacy: Greatest Hits Collection
I long for, the warmth of, days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty, without you
By my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try
When I get the courage to know somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
You're the one that makes me bow under ball and chain
Reminisce, think about
As I watch 4 seasons to change
Here comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and hits the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe (as springtime)
As springtime makes it's way here, lilac blooms remind me of
The scent of your perfume
Reminisce inside of love,
On summer nights, indeed
I always get the hots for you (ooh)
Go skinny dipping in the ocean where we used to do
No no chance the leaves of trees are bare, when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
It doesn't feel the same
Oh
Remember
The nights when (remember the night)
When we closed our eyes (when we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I would be in love for all time
Every time I think about these things I shared
(Think about these things I shared)
I'm not gonna cry, 'cause I get so emotional (I get so emotional)
Underneath it makes me think I'm under ball and chain
Reminisce in our love
As I watch 4 seasons change
Here comes the winter breeze that
That chills the air and hits the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
The springtime makes it's way here lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume (Ooh)
On summer nights, indeed
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dipping in the ocean where we used to do
No no chance the leaves of trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
This loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me baby)
Please let me love again (just one more thing)
Cause I'm devoted girl find me and ease my pain
But 4 seasons will bring
The loneliness again
Here comes the winter breeze that
Chills the air and hits the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes it way here,
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume (Summer nights)
On summer nights, indeed
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dipping in the ocean where we used to do
(Go skinny dipping oh,oh)
No no chance the leaves of trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
Remember,
The warmth of,
Days gone by.
