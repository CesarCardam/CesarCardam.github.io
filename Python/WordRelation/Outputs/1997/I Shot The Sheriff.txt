85. Warren GTake A Look Over Your Shoulder
--Chorus--
I shot the sheriff
--Chorus--
Verse One:
I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable
he mistaked me for somebody who was liable
for all tha many murders l.a and war fields
we keep makin war shields
streets keep souls
young brothers loose control
I seem to maintain through this
watch where ya kick it they'll put you in a twist
and it ain't nobody like my down ass hommie
and tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me
I keep away from fools
they do crime and it attracts cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in
--Chorus--
Verse Two:
They tryin' to stick with some bullshit that I did not do
you know who
the boys in blue
there they go with they assumpitons
slaverys over let us have somethin'
why you want to pull me over?
'cause I'm bumpin?
I just made a new song
my profession is music
your profession is protection with gats
then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today
so I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in
--Chorus--
Verse Three:
I shot the sheriff
I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to
'cause in this game they always tryin' to blast you
and leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder
they harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man
the hommie day-dog got strapped but that's okay
'cause I'm gonna work for life
so he can see another day
a hommies a hommie
a fake is a snake
straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake
so I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in
