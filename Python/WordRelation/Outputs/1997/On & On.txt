Oh my my my
I'm feeling high
My moneys gone
I'm all alone
The world is turnin'
Oh what a day
What a day what a day
Peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learn,
If your knowledge were your wealth then it will be well earn
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in god but they fear us just the same
Oh on and on and on and on
Whew on and on and on and on
I go on and on and on and on
Ohh on and on and on and on
I was born under water with three dollars and six dimes
Yeah you might laugh 'cause you did not do your math
Na qua two...three...
Damn, y'all feel that? Oh...
Qua two...three...
The world keeps turning
Oh what a day what a day what a day
The man that knows something knows that he knows nothing at all
Does it seem colder in your summertime and hotter in your fall
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in god but they fear us just the same
Oh on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
I go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
I am feeling kinda hungry 'cause my high is coming down
Don't feed me yours 'cause your food does not endure
I think I need a cup of tea, the world keeps burnin'
Oh what a day, what a day what a day
You rush into destruction 'cause you don't have nothin' left
The mother ship can't save you so your ass is goin' get it
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in god but they fear us just the same
Oh on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
Ooh ooh wee on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
