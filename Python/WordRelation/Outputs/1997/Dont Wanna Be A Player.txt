84. JoeAll That I Am
Don't wanna be a player
Don't wanna be a player
Don't wanna be a player
Don't wanna be a player
Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
I'm yours, your mine, for sure
I had enough of running wild
I'm switching out my whole lifestyle
I don't wanna live the way I used to
I'm giving up the booty cause
Spinning C's at the ta-ta bars
No leaving with two or three girls to get me off
All I need is one who's really down
Someone to turn this player's life around
Girl I feel like you could be the one
To make a difference in my life
Cause I'm tired of living tripe
Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
I'm yours, your mine, for sure
No rolling with an entourage
Celeb' style like a movie star
Sippin down with the ladies all around me
Laughing girls off at the way I was of the morning
Gettin' beeps from Milan and Delhi
A true player never gets a chance to sleep, no
All I need is one who's really down
Someone to turn this player's life around
Girl I feel like you could be the one
To make a difference in my life
Cause I'm tired of living tripe
Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
I'm yours, your mine, for sure
Baby girl I'm buggin over you
You got me giving up the things I used to do
You got so much in life to gain
And to prove to you I'm getting out the game
No more players style
