48. 702No Doubt
I don't really wanna stay,
I don't really wanna go,
But I really need to know,
Can we get it together,
Get it together.
I don't really wanna go,
I don't really wanna stay,
But I really hope and pray,
Can we get it together,
Get it together.
You don't know the pain that I feel,
You've taken my love for granted,
And you just wanna see it your way.
It's about that time,
I'm gonna tell ya what's on my mind.
I'm fed up with you not being here with me,
When you know love is all I need,
I don't want to stay
I don't really wanna stay,
I don't really wanna go,
But I really need to know,
Can we get it together,
Get it together.
I don't really wanna go,
I don't really wanna stay,
But I really hope and pray,
Can we get it together,
Get it together.
I can't let go,
Cause being confused just takes control.
I hope we can start brand new,
Cause I don't want to loose you.
With the love we shared,
Baby it's oh so rare,
I'm willing to try and make you see,
That all you need is here in me,
I don't want to go
I don't wanna stay,
I don't wanna go,
But you gotta let me know,
How you feel.
How you feel.
I don't really wanna stay,
I don't really wanna go,
But I really need to know,
Can we get it together,
Get it together.
I don't really wanna go,
I don't really wanna stay,
But I really hope and pray,
Can we get it together,
Get it together.
I don't wanna stay,
I don't wanna go,
But you gotta let me know,
How you feel.
How you feel.
See I'm so confused,
I just don't know what to do,
And I don't understand, no.
You know I don't wanna stay,
You know I don't wanna go,
Baby, please listen to me.
I don't really wanna stay,
I don't really wanna go,
But I really need to know,
Can we get it together,
Get it together.
I don't really wanna go,
I don't really wanna stay,
But I really hope and pray,
Can we get it together,
Get it together.
