This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you
Make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you
Make me
You make me
Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be OK
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
Last thing I think about was you
And how
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you
Make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you
Make me
You make me
Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should have been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do
Should I tell my baby bye-bye
Should I do exactly what I feel inside
Could I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you
Make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you
Make me
You make me
At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her
But I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it
While all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it
But the feeling's just too strong
You make me, make me
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You make me wanna
You makin' me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you
Make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with you
Make me
You make me
