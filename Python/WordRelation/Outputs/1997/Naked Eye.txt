81. Luscious JacksonFever In Fever Out
it's not a choice i tried to make
it's not a thought i couldn't take
something told me it was time
to give you yours and leave me mine
my vision started to be clear
i watched the sunlight coming near
i knew the day i knew the night
i knew i could regain my sight
and it feels alright
and it feels alright
with my naked eye
i saw all the falling rain
coming down on me
with my naked eye
i saw all if i said it all
i could see
last night i came into your home
to break some ice and throw some stones
i asked if we could be alone
i had some troubles of my own
knew i had to say goodbye
to all the old things held inside
if i let the moment fly
i knew they'd all be magnified
and it feels alright
and it feels alright
with my naked eye
i saw all the falling rain
coming down on me
with my naked eye
i saw all if i said it all
i could see
with my naked eye
i saw all the falling rain
coming down on me
with my naked eye
i saw all if i said it all
i could see
came around after dark
you are nothing but a lark
know i snuck in like a narc
i knew i had to leave my mark
wanted to be satisfied
i tried to be dignified
wearing nothing is divine
naked is a state of mind
and it feels alright
and it feels alright
with my naked eye
i saw all the falling rain
coming down on me
with my naked eye
i saw all if i said it all
i could see
it feels alright
it feels alright
it feels alright
it feels alright
it feels alright
it feels alright
it feels alright
it feels alright
