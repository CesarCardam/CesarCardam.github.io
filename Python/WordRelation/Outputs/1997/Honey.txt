32. Mariah Carey#1&#039;s
Oh, now you can have me
When you want me
You simply ask me to be there
And you're the only one
Who makes me come running
'Cause what you got
Is far beyond compare
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh, baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out
For another taste of your honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for ya
Crying for ya
I adore ya
One hit of your love affected me
And I'm strung out on you, darling
Don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
