Youre my love, youre my sweetest thing
Dont shy away, dont shy away
Every night makes me hate the days
Cant get enough of your love
Am I wrong? Am I so unkind?
Show me the way, dont turn away
I cant hide all these thoughts in my mind
Every moment I'm thinking of you
Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
You know what Im looking for
Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ill give you love you cant ignore
Feeling good, lets go all the way
Its got to be, set me free
But tonight let my body say
Take it slow, dont let it go
How can I prove my love to you?
Baby please, youre all I need
Like a child but its more than a phase
Could act the angel but it wouldnt be true
Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
You know what Im looking for
Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ill give you love you cant ignore
What can you do for me?
Oh, what can you do?
Cause I feel so alive
I feel your love inside, ooh
Just a little bit, little bit more
Just a little bit, just a little
Just a little bit, little bit more
Just a little bit
Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
You know what Im looking for
Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ill give you love you cant ignore
Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
You know what Im looking for
Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ooh aah, little bit more
Ooh aah, just a little bit
Ill give you love you cant ignore
Just a little bit, little bit more
Just a little bit, just a little
Just a little bit, little bit more
Just a little bit
