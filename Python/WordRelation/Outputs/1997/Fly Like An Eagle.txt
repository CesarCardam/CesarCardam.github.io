Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Time keeps on slipping
Into the future
Time keeps on slipping, slipping, slipping
Into the future
I want to fly like an eagle, to the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly (oh, yeah)
Fly right into the future
I want to feed the babies
Who can't get enough to eat
I want to shoe the children
New shoes on their feet
I want to house the people
Living in the street
Oh, there
There's a solution
I want to fly like an eagle, to the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly (oh, yeah)
Fly right into the future
Time keeps on slipping
Into the future
Time keeps on slipping, slipping, slipping
Into the future
I want to fly like an eagle, to the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly (oh, yeah)
Fly into the future
Fly like an eagle
to the sea
Fly like an eagle
Let my spirit carry me
I want to fly
Like an eagle
Fly into the future
In a sky full of people only some want to fly, isn't that crazy
