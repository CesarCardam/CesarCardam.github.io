What's it gonna be
'Cause I can't pretend
Don't you want to be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go
Don't let go
Have the right to loose control
Don't let go
I often tell myself
That we could be more than just friends
I know you think that if we move to soon
It would all end
I live in misery when you're not around
And I won't be satisfied 'till we're taking those vows
There'll be some lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking
Oh, lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking
What's it gonna be
'Cause I can't pretend
Don't you want to be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go
Don't let go
Have the right to loose control
Don't let go
I often fantasize
The stars above are watching you
They know my heart and speak to yours
Like only lovers do
If I could wear your clothes
I'd pretend I was you and lose control
There'll be some lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking
Oh lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking, oh yeah
What's it gonna be
'Cause I can't pretend
Don't you want to be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go
Don't let go
Have the right to loose control
Don't let go
Running in and out my life has got me so confused
You gotta make the sacrifice
Somebody's got to choose
We can make it if we try for the sake of you and I
Together we can make it right
What's it gonna be
'Cause I can't pretend
Don't you want to be more than friends
Hold me tight and don't let go
Don't let go
Have the right to loose control
Don't let go
