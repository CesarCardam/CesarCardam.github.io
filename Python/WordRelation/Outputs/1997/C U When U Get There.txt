66. Coolioalbum
Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinking
If you ain't peek then you must be drinking
And smokin'
Pretending not to locin' but you're brokin'
Let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and
Little Jimmy got life
And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran away with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought it was funny
But who's the dummy
Now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother got replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya
I know I can't trust ya
'Cause my crew is rollin' home and your crew is rollin' dusta
And just because of that you act you don't like the brother no more
Uh, I guess that's just the way it goes
I ain't tryin' preach
I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared
I see you when you get there
[Chorus]
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
More temptation in faith
I guess we livin' for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet
By a bullet and an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin' lifted
I'm just tryin' to take care of my kids and handle my business
'Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin'
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big horse
Someone's gotta run a little faster coz we gotta lay the struggle
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
And if everbody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter you rag collar deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time somebody up there still love us
I'm a scuff and struggle y'all breathless and weak
I just strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there when you wit the sound bumpin'
[Chorus]
You need to loosen up
And live a little
And if you got kids let 'em know how ya feel
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that
You busy tryina stack
And keep them from the Jones's is taking advantage of your own
The realist homies got you but you known them longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut to describe when
It's something wrong and we desire
So hold your head up high if your poor and righteous
I know time seems dry and problems seem endless
But in times of despair we gotta put ourselves together
And if you feel you're out the game then you need to get back in it
'Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So gather up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle and drive and stop by my side
[Chorus]
As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the strait narrow,
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for somthing or lay down in your game
Listen to the song that we sang
It's up to you to make it be
I guess I'll see you when you see me
[Chorus]
