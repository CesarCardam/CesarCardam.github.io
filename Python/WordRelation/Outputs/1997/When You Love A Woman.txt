57. JourneyThe Essential Journey
In my life I see where I've been
I said that I'd never fall again
Within myself I was wrong
My searchin' ain't over... over
I know that
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
You know she's standin' by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines waiting
Somewhere... oh oh yeah
If I can't believe that someone is true
To fall in love is so hard to do
I hope and pray tonight
Somewhere you're thinking of me girl
Yes I know I... I know that
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
You know she's standin' by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines, waiting
somewhere... oh..oh
it's enough to make you cry.
When you see her walkin' by
And you look into her eyes
oh...oh...oh
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes
When you love a woman
Well you know she's standin' by your side
A joy that lasts forever
There's a band of gold that shines... whoa
When you love a woman...
When you love, love, love
When you love a woman
You see your world inside her eyes.
