85. Timbaland Featuring DrakeShock Value II
This shit was all I knew
You and me, only
I did it all for you
Still, you were lonely
We can work it out
Uhh, But I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
Say say something, baby, say something, baby, say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
Yeah, it really sucks whenever since I've been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see
Your life is good but me and you we're a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied
I need a paramedic girl, I'm feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy
It's crazy, I can't help it if you're really ashamed
All the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change
Ah, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect girl, now it seems we don't match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?
This shit was all I knew
You and me, only
I did it all for you
Still, you were lonely
We can work it out
Uhh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
But I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
Say say something, baby, say something, baby, say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
I am the topic of conversation
This is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's 'all about location'
I'm sitting, drink wine and watch Californication of life
You should have been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up, fifty fifty
But now I'm at the forty forty getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should want to go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gonna be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
As long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?
