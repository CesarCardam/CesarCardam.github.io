77. Selena Gomez & The SceneFor You
Naturally
How you choose to express yourself
It's all your own and I can tell
It comes naturally
It comes naturally
You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive you don't have to try
It comes naturally, hmm it comes naturally
And it takes my breath away (away, away, away)
You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Bay bay bay baby
You have a way of moving me
A force of nature, your energy
It comes naturally
It comes naturally, hmm yeah
And it takes my breath away (away, away, away)
What you do, so naturally
You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Bay bay bay baby
Bay bay bay baby
When we collide, sparks fly
When you look in my eyes, it takes my breath away
(It takes my breath away) (you are!)
You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I know it's meant to be
You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you know who you are
And to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Bay bay baby
Bay bay baby
Everything baby comes naturally
