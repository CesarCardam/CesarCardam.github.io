04. Katy Perry Featuring Snoop DoggTeenage Dream
[Snoop Dogg]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
[Katy Perry]
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees, undone
The boys, break their necks
Trying to creep a little sneak peek, at us
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the Golden Coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh oh oh oh
California gurls
We're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh oh oh oh
California gurls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh
Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh oh
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the Golden Coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh oh oh oh
California gurls
We're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh oh oh oh
California gurls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West Coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh
[Snoop Dogg]
Toned tan, fit and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's getting heavy
Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones
I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her,
Squeeze her buns
The girl's a freak
She drives a jeep
And live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bait, just like I love L.A.
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summer time is everything
Homeboys bangin' out
All that ass hangin' out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis
No weenies
Just a king and a queenie
Katy my lady,
[Katy Perry]
Yeah...
[Snoop Dogg]
You lookie here baby,
[Katy Perry]
Uh huh...
I'm all up on you
'Cause you representin' California
[Katy Perry]
Ohhh yeahh...
California gurls
We're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
Oh oh oh oh
California Gurls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West coast represent
[Snoop Dogg]
West Coast, West Coast
[Katy Perry]
Now put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh
California... California Gurls...
[Snoop Dogg]
California gurls man...
[Katy Perry]
California... California Gurls...
