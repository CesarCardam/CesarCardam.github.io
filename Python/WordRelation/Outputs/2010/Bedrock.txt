I-I-I I can make your bed rock girl
I-I-I I can make your bed rock

She got that good good,
She Michael Jackson bad,
I'm attracted to her, with her attractive ass,
And now we murderers, because we kill time,
I knock her lights out, and she still shine,
I hate to see her go, but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth
Like a soccer team
Cold as a winters day,
Hot as a summer's eve,
Young Money thieves
Steal your love and leave
I like the way you walk, you walkin', if you walkin' my way,
I'm that red bull, now let's fly away,
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space,
I let you be the judge, an' an' and I'm the case,
I'm Gudda Gudda,
I put her under,
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder,
She don't even wonder, cause she know she bad,
And I got her nigga,
Grocery bag.

I love ya sushi roll, hotter than wasabi,
I race for your love,
Shake and bake Ricky Bobby,
I'm at the W but I can't meet you in the lobby,
Girl I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody,
I seen em' stand in line, just to get beside her,
I let her see the Aston, and let the rest surprise her,
That's when we disappear, and you need gps to find her,
Oh that was your girl?

She like tanning,
I like staying in,
She like romancing,
I like rolling with friends,
She said I'm caged in,
I think her conscience is,
She watching that oxygen,
I'm watching ESPN,
But when that show end,
She all on my skin,
Lotion,
Slow motions,
While we roller coastin',
Like back forth hold it (hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it)
She pose like it's for posters,
And I poke like I'm suppose to,
Take this photo if you for me,
She said don't you ever show this,
I'm too loyal (loyal, loyal)
And too focused (focused, focused)
To be losing (losin', losin')
And be hopeless (hopeless, hopeless)
When I spoke this,
She rejoiced it,
Said your word get me open,
So I closed it,
Where your clothes is,
I'm only lovin' for the moment (for the moment, for the moment)
She ain't got a man,
But she's not alone,
Miss independent,
Yea she got her own,
Hey gorgeous,

Well, that's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yea
