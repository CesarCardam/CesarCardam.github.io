53. Jay Sean Featuring Sean Paul & Lil JonAll or Nothing
Hey! Jay Sean
Sean Paul, yeah!
Lil' Jon
This one right here is for all the ladies
Ladies who want to take it back
Holler at them Jay
I've been thinking about you
And how we used to be then
Back when it didn't have to live we could start again
There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day
Just you and me tonight
Everything will be okay
If it's alright with you, then it's alright with me
Baby let's take this time let's make new memories
Do you remember, do you remember, do you remember
All of the times we had
Do you remember, do you remember, do you remember
All of the times we had
Let's bring it back (Bring it back!)
Let's bring it back (Bring it back!)
Let's bring it back (Bring it back!)
Let's bring it back (Bring it back!)

So long since you've been missing
It's good to see you again
How you, how you doing?
And how about we don't let this happen again
There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day
Just you and me tonight
Everything will be okay
If it's alright with you then it's alright with me
Baby let's take this time let's make new memories
Do you remember, do you remember, do you remember
All of the times we had
Do you remember, do you remember, do you remember
All of the times we had

Yo ay girl yo bring it back to the time when you and me had just begun
When I was still your number one
Well it might seem far-fetched baby girl but it can't be done
I've got this feeling fire blazing and it's hot just like the sun
Know you feel it too my girl just freeze up and the good vibes run
Gal take a sip of the champagne,
Take a little trip down my lane my girl
Wildin' out every night and we feel alright
Let me tell you this girl welcome to my world
Don't change, me a nah rearrange my girl
I'm a tell you this straight, that's my word
I hear that you wanna come kiss this girl
Cause you miss this, that's what I heard
That's what I heard that's what I heard word girl
There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day
Just you and me tonight
Everything will be okay
If it's alright with you then it's alright with me
Baby let's take this time let's make new memories
Do you remember, do you remember, do you remember,
All of the times we had
Do you remember, do you remember, do you remember,
All of the times we had
Let's bring it back (Let's bring it back)
Let's bring it back (Bring it back)
