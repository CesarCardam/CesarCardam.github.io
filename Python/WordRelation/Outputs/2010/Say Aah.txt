Tryin' to get you home or would you be Marge Simpson
Whip out front we could leave like pronto
Maple leaf dash got you feelin' like Toronto
Make your body rise like your puffin on a joint though
Girl that's only if you want though (you ready)

Play a little soccer
And bust a couple off
Blacka blacka

You start drunk texting
And suddenly you miss him
Or even wanna diss him
Then you call your girl like
