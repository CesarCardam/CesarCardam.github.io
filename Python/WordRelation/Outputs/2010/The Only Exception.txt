93. ParamoreBrand New Eyes
When I was younger
I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart
And I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore
That she would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love
If it does not exist, but darlin'
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
Maybe I know, somewhere
Deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone
But keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable, distance
And up until now
I had sworn to myself that I'm content
With loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
But, you are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't let go of what's in front of me here
I know your leaving in the morning, when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream, oh
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
You are, the only exception
And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing.
