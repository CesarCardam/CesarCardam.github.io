71. Drake Featuring Kanye West, Lil Wayne & Eminemalbum
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
Last name ever,
First name greatest,
Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with,
It started off local but thanks to all the haters,
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis,
In your city faded off the brown, Nino,
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo,
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo,
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one,
Yeah nigga I'm about my business,
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list,
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness,
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness,
Bitches,
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
Forever ever Mr. West is in da building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams,
Big fame, big chains,
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came,
I went hard all fall like the ball teams,
Just so I can make it rain all spring,
Y'all seen my story my glory,
I had raped the game young,
You can call it statutory,
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothin',
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin,
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband,
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't,
You're such a fucking loser,
He didn't even go to class Bueller,
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back,
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack,
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac,
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act,
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap,
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back,
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
OK, hello it's the martian, Space Jam Jordan's,
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden,
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target,
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans,
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops,
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top,
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops,
But what should I scream for this is my theme park,
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark,
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk,
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention,
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention,
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer,
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover,
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas,
No brake pads no such thing as last,
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
There they go, packing stadiums,
As Shady spits his flow,
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic wow,
We can make them look like bozos,
He's wondering if he should spit this slow,
Fuck no go for broke,
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed,
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose,
Back into the game and they know,
Rap will never be the same as before,
Bashing in the brains of these hoes,
And establishing a name as he goes,
The passion and the flame is ignited,
You can't put it out once we light it,
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot,
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin',
And spit true feelings,
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place,
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face,
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake.
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
