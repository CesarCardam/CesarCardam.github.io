According to you
I'm stupid
I'm useless
I can't do anything right
According to you
I'm difficult
Hard to please
Forever changing my mind
I'm a mess in a dress
Can't show up on time
Even if it would save my life
According to you, according to you
But according to him
I'm beautiful
Incredible
He can't get me out of his head
According to him
I'm funny
Irresistible
Everything he ever wanted
Everything is opposite
I don't feel like stopping it
So baby tell me what I got to lose
He's into me for everything I'm not
According to you
According to you
I'm boring
I'm moody
And you can't take me any place
According to you
I suck at telling jokes cause I always give it away
I'm the girl with the worst attention span
You're the boy who puts up with that
According to you, according to you
But according to him
I'm beautiful
Incredible

According to you
I need to feel appreciated
Like I'm not hated, oh no
Why can't you see me through his eyes?
It's too bad you're making me decide

You're useless
You can't do anything right
