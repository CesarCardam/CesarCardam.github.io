Absolutely no one who knows me better
No one that can make me feel so good
How did we stay so long together
When everybody
Everybody said we never would
And just when I
I start to think they're right
That love has died
There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time,
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know I'm never letting this go
I'm stuck on you
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me baby
We're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me baby
We're stuck like glue
Some days I don't feel like trying
Some days you know I wanna just give up
When it doesn't matter who's right
Fight about it all night
Had enough
You give me that look
I'm sorry baby let's make up
You do that thing that makes me laugh
And just like that
There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know I'm never letting this go
I'm stuck on you
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me baby
We're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me baby
We're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
You almost stay out
Too stuck together from the A-T-L
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Feeling kinda sick
Just a spoon full of sugar make it better real quick
I say, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
What'cha gonna do with that
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Come on over here with that
Sugar sticky sweet stuff
Come on give me that stuff
Everybody want some
Melodies that get stuck
Up in your head
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Up in your head
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Up in your head
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Up in your head
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me together
Say it's all I wanna do I said
There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know (I know)
I'm never letting this go (never letting this go)
There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know (know)
I'm never letting this go (never letting this go)
I'm stuck on you
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me baby
We're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me baby
We're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me baby
We're stuck like glue
