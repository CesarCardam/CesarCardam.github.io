Come on
Everybody's looking for love, oh, oh
Ain't that the reason you're at this club, oh oh
You ain't gonna find a dance with him, no oh
Got a better solution for you girl, oh. oh
Just leave with me now, say the word and we'll go (and we'll go)
I'll be your teacher, I'll show you the ropes (you the ropes)
You'll see a side of love you've never known
I can see it going down, going down
In my head, I see you all over me
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy
In my head, you'll be screaming more
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down
In my head, yeah, in my head oh yeah
Some dudes know all the right things to say, oh oh
When it comes down to it, it's all just game
Instead of talking let me demonstrate, yeah
Get down to business and skip foreplay, eh
Just leave with me now, say the word and we'll go (we can go)
I'll be your teacher, I'll show you the ropes (show you the ropes)
You'll see a side of love you've never known (never known)
I can see it going down, going down
In my head, I see you all over me
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy
In my head, you'll be screaming more
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down
In my head
Break it down, ay-oh, come on, ay-oh, let's go, ay-oh
You singing to me baby in my head right now, ay-oh, ay-oh, come on
Ooh, she'll be screaming out when it all goes down
Just leave with me now, say the word and we'll go (we can go)
I'll be your teacher, I'll show you the ropes (show you the ropes)
You'll see a side of love you've never known (never known)
I can see it going down, going down
In my head, I see you all over me
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy
In my head, you'll be screaming more
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down
In my head, I see you all over me
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy
In my head, you'll be screaming more
In my head, it's going down
In my head, it's going down
In my head
