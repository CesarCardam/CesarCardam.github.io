26. David Guetta Featuring Akonalbum
Yes I can see her
Cause every girl in here wanna be her
Oh she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town
She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood ho
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
The way that booty movin' I can't take no more
Have to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull up close
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
Damn girl
Damn she's a sexy chick
A sexy chick
Damn she's a sexy chick
Damn girl
Damn she's a sexy chick
A sexy chick
Damn she's a sexy chick
Damn girl
Yes I can see her
Cause every girl in here wanna be her
Oh she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town
She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood whore
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
The way that booty movin' I can't take no more
Have to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull up close
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful
Damn girl
Damn she's a sexy chick
A sexy chick
Damn she's a sexy chick
Damn girl
Damn you're a sexy chick
A sexy chick
Damn you're a sexy chick
Damn girl
Damn you're a sexy chick
A sexy chick
Damn you're a sexy chick
Damn girl
Damn you're a sexy chick
A sexy chick
Damn you're a sexy chick
Damn you're a sexy chick
