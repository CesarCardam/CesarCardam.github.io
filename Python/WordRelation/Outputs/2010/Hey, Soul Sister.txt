03. TrainSave Me San Francisco
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Your lipstick stains
On the front part of my
Left side brain
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you
Blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every
Single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind
Hey soul sister
Ain't that Mr. mister
On the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair, you know
