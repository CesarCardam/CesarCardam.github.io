73. 3OH!3 Featuring Ke$haStreets Of Gold
My first kiss went a little like this
Mwah mwah and twist
Mwah mwah and twist
Well my first kiss went a little like this
And twist
And twist
I said no more teachers
And no more books
I got a kiss under the bleachers
Hoping that nobody looked
Lips like licorice
Tongue like candy
Excuse me miss but can I get you out your panties
In the back of the car,
on the way to the bar
I got you on my lips
(I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs
With my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it
She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh, ooh
She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh, ooh
My first kiss went a little like this
I said no more sailors and no more soldiers
With your name in a heart tattooed up on the shoulders
Your kiss is like whiskey, it gets me drunk
And I wake up in the morning with the taste of your tongue
In the back of the car on the way to the bar
I got you on my lips
(I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs
With my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it
She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh, ooh
She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh, ooh
My first kiss went a little like this
And twist, and twist
Well, my first kiss went a little like this
And twist
And twist
Yeah, she won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh,
She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh, ooh
She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh, ooh
She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
