Maybe i need some rehab
or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seein it in my dreams
I'm lookin down every alley
i'm makin those desperate calls
i'm stayin up all night hopin hitin my head against the wall
what you got boy, is hard to find
i think about it all the time
i'm all strung out my heart is fried
i just cant get you off my mind!
because your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love
i said your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love
wont listen to any advice
mommas tellin me i should think twice
but look into my own devices, im addicted its a crisis
my friends think i've gone crazy
my judgments gettin kinda hazy
My esteem is gonna be affected if i keep it up like a love sick crack head
what you got boy, is hard to find
i think about it all the time
im all strung out my heart is fried
i just cant get you off my mind!
because your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love
i said your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love
i dont care what people say
the rush is worth the price i pay
i get so high when your with me
but crash and crave you when you leave
hey, so i got a question
do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
do i make your heart beat like an 808 drum
is my love your drug? your drug?
hi, your drug?
hi, your drug?
is my love your drug?
because your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love
i said your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love
because your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love
i said your love your love your love is my drug
your love your love your love
hey, hey, so
you love, your love your love, is my drug
i like your beard
