100. Jerrod NiemannJudge Jerrod and the Hung Jury
Well the truth,
Well it hurts to say,
I'm gonna pack up my bags
And I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split
I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit
Ain't never comin' back
Girl but before I get to go and I got to say
I know you used to love me
But that was yesterday
And the truth I won't fight it
When the love starts burnin' you got to do what's right
Whoa lover, lover, lover,
You don't treat me no good no more
Whoa lover, lover, lover,
You don't treat me no good no more
Well the truth,
Yeah it hurts to say,
I'm gonna pack up my bags
And I'm gonna go away
I'm gonna split
I can't stand it
I'm gonna give it up and quit
Ain't never comin' back
Girl but before I get to go and I got to say
There was a time oh woman
When you used to shake it for me
Now all you do is just treat me cold
Ain't gonna take it no more
Gonna walk out the door
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more,
No good no more, more, more
Lover lover lover
You don't treat me no good no more
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well I wait up for you almost every night
And I'm hurtin' so bad cause you don't treat me right
Oh woman oh woman you know I love you so but
You're so mean to me baby I'm walkin' out the door
Lover oh lover
Yeah, yeah
No good no more, more, more
I know you used to love me in every way,
But now I'm givin' it up
And I'm tired of cryin' babe
I can't stand it no longer
It hurts me to say,
But I'm packin' up my bags and goin' far away
Lover, oh lover, yeah, yeah
Lover, lover, lover,
You don't treat me no good no more
Lover, lover, lover,
You don't treat me no good no more
Lover, lover, lover,
You don't treat me no good no more
Lover, lover, lover
You don't treat me no good no more
