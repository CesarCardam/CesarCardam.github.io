65. New Boyz Featuring Ray JSkinny Jeanz &amp; A Mic
Hey, Hey (aye, aye)
'Cause she ain't gon' tie me down
'Cause she ain't gon' tie me down
She ain't gon' tie me down
So why you on the road
You wanted all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes
What you want right now
What up right now,
I think you need to close yo mouth
'Cause you ain't gon' tie me down, tie me down, tie me down
You ain't gon' tie me down
You ain't gon' tie me down
Know we been together for a minute
But a, it's kinda been forever since we been in
The kinda situation not involving other women
And it's pretty obvious that you're kinda trippin', like
"Who the hell is this bitch lookin' a hot mess
What you fell for this chick"
You know we got problems and you failed to fix it
I'm like, "you need to go somewhere else with this shit
Because I ain't gon' put up wit you
Talkin' bout how she make you uncomfortable
I mean, shit I'm only 17
And um, a perfect couples only in a dream
And right now I'm pretty much away for this relationship
I think we should wait for it
I mean later we can try things out
But not right now
She ain't gon' tie me down
So why you on the road
You wanted all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes
What you want right now
What up right now,
I think you need to close yo mouth
'Cause you ain't gon' tie me down, tie me down, tie me down
You ain't gon' tie me down
You ain't gon' tie me down
Ha, ha, aye girl waddup
No I'm not gon' make a scene
But you cant tie me down like a pair of shoe strings
Yea you cute, so what
But let's get it through your head
Yea we make love, sex weed all in the bed
It's the best and I love her but things don't change
When I'm not faithful you be feelin' ma pain
Now you stuck like a stain and I cant believe that
Baby girl one hundred,I ain't tryna do that
Got too many girls and I ain't letting go
'Cause my life is great and you ain't nothin' but a hoe
Yea you come to my shows and you very supportive
Just showed me a camera and my show recorded
It was nice, I'm surprised that you still standin' here
As you know I'm a man and I have no feelings
I'ma start from the top, girl this ain't no lovin'
I'm a New Boy, girl so
She ain't gon' tie me down
So why you on the road
You wanted all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes
What you want right now
What up right now,
I think you need to close yo mouth
'Cause you ain't gon' tie me down, tie me down, tie me down
You ain't gon' tie me down
You ain't gon' tie me down
She ain't gon' tie me down
So why you on the road
You wanted all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes
What you want right now
What up right now,
I think you need to close yo mouth
'Cause you ain't gon' tie me down, tie me down, tie me down
You ain't gon' tie me down
You ain't gon' tie me down
