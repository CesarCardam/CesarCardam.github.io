Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
That I've ever seen
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
One night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco
I was cruisin' with my favourite gang
The place was so borin' filled with out-of-towners tourin'
I knew that it wasn't my thing
I really wasn't carin', but I felt my eyes starin'
At a guy who stuck out in the crowd
He had the kind of body that would shame Adonis
And a face that would make any man proud
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
That I've ever seen (Ooh)
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
The champion of dance, his moves would put you in a trance
And he never leaves the disco alone
Arrogance but not conceit, as a man he's complete
My creme de la creme, please take me home
He wears the finest clothes, the best designers heaven knows
Ooh, from his head down to his toes
Halston, Gucci, Fiorucci
He looks like a still, that man is dressed to kill
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
That I've ever seen (I've ever seen)
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
That I've ever seen
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
That I've ever seen (I've ever seen)
Oh, what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what, wow
Ooh ooh
