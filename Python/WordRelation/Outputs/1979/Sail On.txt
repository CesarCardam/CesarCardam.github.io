Sail on down the line 'bout-a half-a mile or so
And-a don't really wanna know-a where you're goin'
Maybe once or twice, you see, time after time
I tried-a to, to hold on to what we got, but-a now you're goin'
And I don't mind about the things you're gonna say, Lord
I gave all my money, and my time
I know it's a shame, but I'm givin' you back your name, yeah, yeah
Yes I'll be on my way, I won't be back to stay
I guess I'll move along, I'm lookin' for a good time
Sail on down the line, ain't it funny how the time can go on-a
Friends say they told me so, but it doesn't matter
It was plain to see that a small town boy like me
Just-a wasn't your cup of tea
It was wishful thinkin'
I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothin' in return
You know, it ain't so hard to say, "Would you please just go away," yeah, yeah
I've thrown away the blues, I'm tired of bein' used
I want everyone to know I'm lookin' for a good time, good time
Sail on honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on honey
Good times never felt so good
Sail on sugar
Good times never felt so good
