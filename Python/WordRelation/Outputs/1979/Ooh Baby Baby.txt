77. Linda RonstadtLiving in the U.S.A.
Ooo la la la la
I did you wrong my heart went out to play
But in the game I lost you
What a price to pay, hey I'm crying
Ooo baby baby
Ooo baby baby
Mistakes I know I've made a few
But I'm only human
You've made mistakes too, I'm crying
Ooo baby baby
Ooo baby baby
I'm just about at the end of my rope
But I can't stop trying I can't give up hope
'Cause I feel that one day I'll hold you near
Whisper I still love you
Until that day is here I'm crying
Ooo baby baby
Ooo baby baby
Ooo baby baby
Ooo baby baby ooo
