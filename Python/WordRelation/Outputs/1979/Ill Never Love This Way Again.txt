32. Dionne Warwickalbum
You looked inside my fantasies and made each one come true,
something no one else had ever found a way to do.
I've kept the memories one by one, since you took me in
and I know I'll never love this way again.
I know I'll never love this way again,
so I keep holdin' on before the good is gone.
I know I'll never love this way again,
hold on, hold on, hold on.
A fool will lose tomorrow reaching back for yesterday;
I won't turn my head in sorrow if you should go away.
I'll stand here and remember just how good it's been,
and I know I'll never love this way again.
I know I'll never love this way again,
So I keep holdin' on before the good is gone.
I know I'll never love this way again,
hold on, hold on, hold on.
I know I'll never love this way again,
So I keep holdin' on before the good is gone.
I know I'll never love this way again,
hold on, hold on.
I know I'll never love this way again,
So I keep holdin' on before the good is gone.
I know I'll never love this way again,
hold on, hold on.
