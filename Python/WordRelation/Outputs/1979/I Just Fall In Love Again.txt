72. Anne MurrayThe Best...So Far
Dreamin', I must be dreamin'
Or am I really lying here with you?
Baby, you take me in your arms
And though I'm wide awake, I know my dream is comin' true
And oh I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then it happens every time
There I go by, just fall in love again and when I do
I can't help myself, I fall in love with you
Magic, it must be magic
The way I hold you when the night just seems to fly
Easy for you to take me to a star
Heaven is that moment when I look into your eyes.
And oh I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then it happens every time
There I go by, just fall in love again and when I do
I can't help myself, I fall in love with you
