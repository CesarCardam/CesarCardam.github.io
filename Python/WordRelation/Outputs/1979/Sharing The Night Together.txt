46. Dr. HookTimeless
You're looking kinda lonely girl
Would you like someone new to talk to, ah yeh alright
I'm feeling kinda lonely too
If you don't mind can I sit down here beside you
Ah yeah alright
If I seem to come on too strong
I hope that you will understand
I say these things 'cause I'd like to know
If you're as lonely as I am
And if you mind
Sharing the night together, oh yeah
Sharing the night together, oh yeah, sharing the night.
We could bring in the morning girl
If you want to go that far
And if tomorrow find us together
Right here the way we are
Would you mind
Sharing the night together, oh yeah
Sharing the night together, oh yeah, sharing the night.
Would you like to dance with me and hold me
You know I want to be holding you
Ah yeah alright 'cause I like feeling like I do
And I see in your eyes
That you're liking it too, ah yeah alright
Like to get to know you better
Is there a place where we can go
Where we can be alone together
And turn the lights down low and start sharing the night
