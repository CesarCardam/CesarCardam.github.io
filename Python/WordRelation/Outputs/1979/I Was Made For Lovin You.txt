Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Tonight I want to give it all to you
In the darkness
There's so much I want to do
And tonight I want to lay it at your feet
Cause girl, I was made for you
And girl, you were made for me
I was made for lovin' you baby
You were made for lovin' me
And I can't get enough of you baby
Can you get enough of me
Tonight I want to see it in your eyes
Feel the magic
There's something that drives me wild
And tonight we're gonna make it all come true
Cause girl, you were made for me
And girl I was made for you
I was made for lovin' you baby
You were made for lovin' me
And I can't get enough of you baby
Can you get enough of me
I was made for lovin' you baby
You were made for lovin' me
And I can give it all to you baby
Can you give it all to me
Oh, can't get enough, oh, oh
I can't get enough, oh, oh

Yeah, ha
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
I was made for lovin' you baby
You were made for lovin' me
And I can't get enough of you baby
Can you get enough of me
Oh, I was made, you were made
I can't get enough
No, I can't get enough

You were made for lovin' me
And I can't get enough of you baby
Can you get enough of me
