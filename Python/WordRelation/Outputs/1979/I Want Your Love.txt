I want your love, I want your love
Do you feel like you ever want
To try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby can't you see, when you look at me
I can't kick this feelin' when it hits
All alone in my bed at night
I grab m pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you and I dream of you all the time.
What am I gonna do?
I want your love, I want your love
Sometime, don't you feel like you
Never really had a love that's real?
Well, here I am, and who's to say
A better love you won't find today?
Just one chance and I will show you love
Like no other, two steps above
On your ladder I'll be a peg
I want your lovin', please don't make me beg
