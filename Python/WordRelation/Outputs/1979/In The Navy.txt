Where can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure
Learn science technology?
Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true
On the land or on the sea?
Where can you learn to fly, play in sports and skin dive
Study oceanography?
Sign off for the big band or sit in the grandstand
When your team and others meet
In the navy
Yes, you can sail the seven seas
In the navy
Yes, you can put your mind at ease
In the navy
Come on people, fall an' make a stand
In the navy, in the navy
Can't you see we need a hand
In the navy
Come on, protect the motherland
In the navy
Come on and join your fellow man
In the navy
Come on people and make a stand
In the navy, in the navy, in the navy, oh
They want you, they want you
They want you as a new recruit
If you like adventure, don't you wait to enter
The recruiting office fast
Don't you hesitate, there is no need to wait
They're signing up new seamen fast
Maybe you are too young to join up today
But don't you worry 'bout a thing
For I'm sure there will be always a good navy
Protecting the land and sea
In the navy
Yes, you can sail the seven seas
In the navy
Yes, you can put your mind at ease
In the navy
Come on people, fall an' make a stand
In the navy, in the navy
Can't you see we need a hand
In the navy
Come on, protect the motherland
In the navy
Come on and join your fellow man
In the navy
Come on people and make a stand
In the navy, in the navy, in the navy, in the navy
They want you, they want you
They want you as a new recruit
Who me?
They want you, they want you
They want you as a new recruit
But, but, but, I'm afraid of water
Hey, hey look man
I get seasick even watchin' it on TV
They want you, they want you in the navy
Oh my goodness
They want you
What am I gonna do in a submarine?
They want you
They want you, they want you in the navy
In the navy
Yes, you can sail the seven seas
In the navy
Yes, you can put your mind at ease
In the navy
Come on people, fall in make a stand
In the navy, in the navy
Can't you see we need a hand
In the navy
Come on, protect the motherland
In the navy
Come on and join your fellow man
