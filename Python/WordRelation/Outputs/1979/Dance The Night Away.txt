Have you seen her?
So fine and pretty
Fooled me with her style and ease
And I feel her from across the room
Yes, it's love in the third degree
Oh, baby baby
Won't-cha turn your head my way?
Oh, baby baby
Ah come on take a chance
You're old enough to
Dance the night away
Whoa-oh (ah) come on g-girl, dance the night away
A live wire, barely a beginner
But just watch that lady go
She's on fire, 'cause dancin' gets her higher than-uh
Anything else she knows
Oh, baby baby
Won't-cha turn your head my way?
Oh, baby baby
Well don't skip romance 'cause
You're old enough to
Dance the night away
Oh oh oh (ah) come on g-girl, dance the night away
Oh, oh oh oh oh yeah
Dance the night away hey, hey, yeah
Dance, dance, dance the night away
Ah come on baby (dance the night away) hey, hey yeah
Dance, dance, dance the night away
Uh, come on baby, baby, dance the night away oh, ooh, yeah
Dance, dance, dance the night away ah, ha ow
