Sittin' here, eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall
Lookin' for some hot stuff, baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight
(Hot stuff)
I need hot stuff
I want some hot stuff
I need hot stuff
Lookin' for a lover who needs another
Don't want another night on my own
Wanna share my love with a warm blooded lover
Wanna bring a wild man back home
Gotta have some hot love baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'
Gotta have some lovin'
Got to have a love tonight
(Hot stuff)

Hot love
Lookin' for hot love

I need some hot stuff baby tonight
Gimme little hot stuff baby this evenin'
Hot stuff baby
Gonna need your love tonight
(Hot stuff)
I need hot love
Lookin' for hot love
Wanna have hot love
Sittin' here eating my heart no reason
Won't spend another night on my own
I dialed about a hundred numbers baby
I'm bound to find somebody home
Gonna have some hot stuff, baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby tonight
Looking for my hot stuff, baby this evenin'
Need some loving baby
Gonna need your love tonight
