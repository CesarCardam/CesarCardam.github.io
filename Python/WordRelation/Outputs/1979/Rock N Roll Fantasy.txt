Mmmmm Mmmmmm
Mmmmm Mmmmmm.
I get up in the morning and it's just another day
Pack up my belongings, I've got to get away.
Jump in to a taxi and the time is gettin' tight
I go to keep on movin' I got a show tonight
Mmmm,
And I'm movin' on, movin' on from town to town
Movin' on, baby, yeah I'm never touchin' the ground. Yeah.
I take it to the ticket there's a half a dollar boat
headin' for the bordengate I'm feelin' pretty low
Fifteen minutes later, I'm sittin' on my plane
fastened in my safety belt I'm takin off again
And I'm movin' on, movin' on from town to town
Movin' on, baby, yeah I'm never touchin' the ground.
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh. Yeah.
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.
And I'm movin' on, movin' on from town to town
Movin' on, I can't seem to stop now.
I got to move on, move on from town to town.
I got to move on, I never seem to slow down.
Oh, I got to move on, move on from town to town.
I got to move on, I never seem to slow down.
