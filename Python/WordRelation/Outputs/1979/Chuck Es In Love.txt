63. Rickie Lee JonesTwelve Bars Past Midnight
How come he don't come and PIP with me
Down at the meter no more?
How come he turn off the TV?
And he hang that sign on the door?
We call and we call
"How come?" we say
What could make a boy behave this way?
So he has learnt all of the lines now
And every time, he don't stutter when he talks
It's true! It's true!
He sure is acquired a cool and inspired sorta jazz when he walks
Where's his jacket and his old blue jeans?
This ain't healthy this is some kinda clean?
I think Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love
I don't believe what you're saying to me
This is something I have to see
Is he here?
I look in the poolhall
Is he here?
I look in the drugstore
Is he here?
No, he don't come here no more
I'll tell you what, I saw him
He was sitting behind us down in the pantages
And whatever it is that he's got up his sleeve
I hope it isn't contagious
What's her name?
Is this her there?
Christ, I think he's even combed his hair
Is that her ?
What's her name?
Oh, it's never gonna be the same
But that's not her
I know what's wrong
Chuck E.'s in love
With the little girl who's singin' this song
Don't you know?
That Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love oh my
Chuck E.'s
Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love with me
