100. Firefallalbum
Didn't I hear you cry this mornin
didn't I feel you weep
Teardrops falling down on me
Like rivers in my sleep
In my dream of laughter
You came creeping with your tears
Telling me your sorrow
In the trace ends of your tears
That's a strange way to tell me you love me
When your sorrow is all I can see
If you just want to cry to somebody
Don't cry to me
No don't cry to me
Didn't I hear your voice this morning
Didn't you call my name
I heard you whisper softly
But the words were never plain
And in your dream of darkness
I came shinin like a sun
Waiting for the laughter
But the last I never caught
(Repeat Chorus)
Didn't you feel alone this mornin
didn't you need a friend
And in your darkest hour
You came runnin back again
In my dream of laughter
You came creeping with your tears
Telling me your sorrow
In the trace end of your tears
That's a strange way to tell me you love me
When your sorrow is all I can see
If you just want to cry to somebody
Don't cry to me
No don't cry to me
Don't cry to me
Don't cry to me
Don't cry to me
That's a strange way to tell me you love me
That's a strange way to tell me you love me
That's a strange way to tell me you love me
