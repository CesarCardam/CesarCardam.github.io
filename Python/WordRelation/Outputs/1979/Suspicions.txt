85. Eddie Rabbittalbum
I'm so glad that I met you, baby.
And I'm so proud when we walk down the street.
And I know it's crazy to worry like I do.
But I get this feelin' that I'm losing you.
I get these suspicions even though
I know that you love me, baby,
and I really shouldn't feel this way.
Suspicions, I can't help it you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me.
When I go out to a party with you
You always turn every head in the room.
And I just know what's on every man's mind
I try to fight it, but it gets me sometimes.
I get these suspicions even though
I know that you love me, baby,
and I really shouldn't feel this way.
Suspicions, I can't help it you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me.
When I'm with you, I feel so satisfied.
The way you touch me when you lay by my side.
And that look you get in your eyes when we love
Makes me hate myself for what I'm thinkin' of.
I get these suspicions even though
I know that you love me, baby,
and I really shouldn't feel this way.
Suspicions, I can't help it you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me.
I get these suspicions even though
I know that you love me, baby,
and I really shouldn't feel this way.
Suspicions, I can't help it you're just so good lookin'
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me.
