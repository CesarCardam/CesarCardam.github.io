97. Diana RossLife &amp; Love: The Very Best Of Diana Ross
Fancy me
Thought I had my degree
In life and how love
Ought to be a run
I had a one step plan to prove it
Guide in my pocket for fools
Folly and fun
Love had to show me one thing
I was so right, so right
Thought I could turn emotion, on and off
I was so sure, so sure
But love taught me
Who was, who was, who was the boss
I?d defy
Anyone who claimed that I
Didn't control
Whatever moved in my soul
I could tempt, touch, delight
Just because you fell for me
Why should I feel uptight
Love had to show me one thing
I was so right, so right
Thought I could turn emotion, on and off
I was so sure, I was so, so sure
But love taught me
Taught me who was, who was, the boss
Love taught me, taught me
Taught me, taught me
I was so right, so right
Thought I could turn emotion, on and off
I was so sure, so sure
But love taught me
Taught me who was, who was, the boss
Love taught me
Love taught me who was the boss
Love taught me who was the boss
Love taught me, love taught me
Love taught me who was the boss
