73. Ian MatthewsStealin Home
Here she comes ridin'
Rollin' it down the line
Slipin' and slidin'
Takin' her sweet old time
And laughin' all the way to the parking lot
Knowin' in the back of her mind
She's gonna show the boy what she's really got
And stop him in the nick of time
[Chorus:]
Shake it baby, shake it all you can tonight
Go on and, and break 'em baby
Break 'em all you can tonight
'Cause it won't last forever
But do it for worse or for better
And give the boy somethin' to dream on later
Here she comes slidin'
Shakin' it down the hall
She's got a picture in her locker
An autographed basketball
She's got a purse that was made in Mexico (Mexico)
A mind that was made for love
She's got a new way of dancin' slow
She knows what you're thinkin' of
[Chorus]
It won't last forever
But do it for worse or for better
And give the boy somethin' to dream on later, and
[Chorus to Fade]
