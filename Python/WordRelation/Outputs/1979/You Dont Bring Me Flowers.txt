21. Barbra Streisand & Neil DiamondThe Essential Barbra Streisand
You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When I come through the door at the end of the day
I remember when
You couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after lovin' me late at night
When it's good for you, babe
And you're feeling alright
Well, you just roll over
And turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore
It used to be so natural (used to be)
To talk about forever
But used-to-bes don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor 'til we sweep them away
Baby, I remember
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry
Well, I learned how to love
And I learned how to lie
So you'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye
You don't bring me flowers anymore
Well, you'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye
You don't say you need me
And you don't sing me love songs
You don't bring me flowers anymore
