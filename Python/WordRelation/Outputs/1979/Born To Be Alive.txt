We were born to be, alive
We were born to be, alive
Born, born to be alive (born to be alive)
You see we're born, born, born, born to be alive
Times was on my side when I runnin'in the street it was the
By by by
A suitcase and an old guitar and something new to occupy my
Mind mind mind
You see we're born, born, born to be alive (born too be alive)
You see we're born, born, born to be alive (born too be alive)
People ask me why I never find a place to stop and settle
Down down down
But I never wanted all the things that people need to justify their
Lives lives lives
You see we're born, born, born to be alive (born too be alive)
You see we're born, born, born
It's good to be alive, to be alive, to be alive
It's good to be alive, to be alive, to be alive
It's good to be alive
Times was on my side when I runnin'in the street it was the
By by by
A suitcase and an old guitar and something new to occupy my
Mind mind mind
You see we're born, born, born to be alive (born too be alive)
You see we're born, born, born
You see we're born, born, born to be alive (born too be alive)
You see we're born, born, born
You see we're born, born, born to be alive (born too be alive)
You see we're born, born, born
Born to be alive
You see we're born, born, born to be alive (born too be alive)
You see we're born, born, born, born to be alive.
