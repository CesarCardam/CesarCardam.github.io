Ooh
Ooh
She sits alone, waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous, avoiding all the questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking?
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so (tell me so, babe)
He's acting shy, looking for an answer
Come on, honey, let's spend the night together
Now, hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high-rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, honey tell me so
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar let me know
His heart's beating like a drum
'Cause at last he's got this girl home
Relax, baby, now we're all alone
They wake at dawn, 'cause all the birds are singing
Two total strangers, but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty, and it's raining
They got each other, neither one's complaining
He says, I'm sorry, but I'm out of milk and coffee
Never mind, sugar, we can watch the early movie
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on, sugar, let me know
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, honey, tell me so
Ooh
Sugar
If you really need me, just reach out and touch me
Come on, sugar let me know
If you really need me (need me, need me, really need me
Just let me know
Just reach out and touch me
Ooh
If you really want me just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar let me know
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on Sugar let me know
If you, if you, if you really need me
Just come on and tell me so
Ooh
