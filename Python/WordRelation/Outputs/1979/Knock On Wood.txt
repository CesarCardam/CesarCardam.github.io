I don't want to lose you, this good thing
That I got 'cause if I do
I will surely
Surely lose a lot
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock on wood, baby
Baby
I'm not superstitious about ya
But I can't take no chance
You got me spinnin', baby
You know I'm in a trance
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock on wood, baby
Baby
You better knock, knock on wood, baby
You better knock, knock on wood, baby
You better knock, knock knock, knock, knock
It's no secret about it
'Cause we're this lovin' touch
He sees to it
That I get enough
Fell his touch all over
You know it means so much
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock, knock on wood, baby
Baby
You better knock, knock on wood, baby
You better knock, knock on wood, baby
You better knock, knock on wood, baby
You better knock, knock on wood, baby
You better knock, knock on wood, baby
You better knock, knock on wood, baby
You better knock, knock on wood
