82. Eric ClaptonComplete Clapton
I don't care if you never come home
I don't mind if you just keep on rowin' away on a distant sea
'Cause I don't love you and you don't love me
You cause a commotion when you come to town
You give 'em a smile and they melt
And your lovers and friends is all good and fine
But I don't like yours and you don't like mine
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
I don't care what you do at night
Oh, I don't care how you get you delites
We'll leave it alone and just let it be
I don't love you and you don't love me
I got a problem, can you relate
I got a woman callin' love hate
We made a vow we'd always be friends
How could we know that promises end
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
I tried to love for years upon years
You refuse to take me for real
It's time you saw what I want you to see
I'd still love you if you'd just love me
I got a problem, can you relate
I got a woman callin' love hate
We made a vow we'd always be friends
How could we know that promises end
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Wohoo, la la la la la la la
