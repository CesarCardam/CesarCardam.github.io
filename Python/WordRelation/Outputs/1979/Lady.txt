42. Little River Bandalbum
Look around you, look up here
Take time to make time
Make time to be there
Look around, be a part
Feel for the winter
But don't have a cold heart
And I love you best
You're not like the rest
You're there when I need you
You're there when I need
I'm gonna need you
A long time ago
I had a lady to love
She made me think of things
I never thought of
Now she's gone and I'm on my own
A love song has come into my mind
A love song
It was there all the time
So lady
Let me take a look at you now
You're there on the dance floor
Making me want you somehow
Oh lady
I think it's only fair
I should say to you
Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you
'Cause maybe I do
Look around, come to me
I have no answers
But know where I wanna be
I look around, play a part
I was born in the winter
And cooled by a warm heart
And I love you best
You're not like the rest
You're there when I need you
You're there when I need
I'm gonna need you
So lady
Let me take a look at you now
You're there on the dance floor
Making me want you somehow
Oh lady
I think it's only fair I should say to you
Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you
'Cause maybe I do
Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you
Lady I do
