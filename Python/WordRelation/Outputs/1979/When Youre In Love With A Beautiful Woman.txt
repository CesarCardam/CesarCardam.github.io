13. Dr. HookTimeless
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard;
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her;
Everybody wants to take your baby home;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends;
You, know that it's crazy and you wanna trust her;
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone.
Maybe it's just an ego problem;
Problem is that I've been fooled before;
by fairweather friends and faint hearted lovers;
And every time it happens, it just convinces me more;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes;
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies;
'Cause everybody tempts her,
everybody tells her she's the most beautiful woman they know;
