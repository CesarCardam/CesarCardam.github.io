23. Suzi Quatro & Chris NormanThe Girl From Detroit City
Our love is alive and so we begin
Foolishly layin' our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
Our love is a flame burnin' within
Now and then fire light will catch us stumblin' in.
Wherever you go, whatever you do
You know these reckless thoughts of mine are followin' you
I've fallen for you, whatever you do
'Cause baby you've shown me so many things that I never knew
Whatever it takes, baby, I'll do it for you
[Chorus:]
You were so young and I was so free
I may have been young but baby, that's not what I wanted to be
Well you were the one, oh why was it me?
'Cause baby you've shown me so many things that I'd never knew
Whatever you need, baby, you got it from me
[Chorus:]
