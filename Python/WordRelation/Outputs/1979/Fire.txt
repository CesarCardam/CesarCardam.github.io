15. Pointer Sistersalbum
I'm ridin' in your car
You turn on the radio
You're pullin' me close
I just say no
I say I don't like it
But you know I'm a liar
'Cause when we kiss, oh
Fire
Late at night
You're takin' me home
You say you want to stay
I say I want to be alone
I say I don't love you
But you know I'm a liar
'Cause when we kiss, ooh
Fire
You had a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin', actin' like a fool
Well, your kisses they burn, but my heart stays cool
Well, Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Delilah
Baby you can bet
A love they couldn't deny
My words say split
But my words they lie
'Cause when we kiss, oh
Fire
