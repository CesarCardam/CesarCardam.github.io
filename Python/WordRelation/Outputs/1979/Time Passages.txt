79. Al StewartOriginal Album Series, Vol. 2
It was late in December, the sky turned to snow
All 'round the day was going down slow
Night like a river, beginning to flow
I felt the beat of my mind go
drifting into time passages
Years go falling in the fading light
time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight.
Well, I'm not the kind to live in the past
the years run too short, and the days too fast
The things you lean on are the things that don't last
well its just now and then, my line gets cast into these
time passages
There's something back there that you left behind
oh time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight.
Hear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn
Don't know why you should feel
that there's something to learn
it's just a game that you play.
Well, the picture is changing now you're part of the crowd
they're laughing at something and the music's loud
a girl comes toward you, you once used to know
you reach out your hand, but you're all alone in those
time passages
I know you're in there, you're just out of sight,
oh time passages
buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight
