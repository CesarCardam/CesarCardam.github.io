36. Petula Clarkalbum
Every day when the work is behind you
And the shop and the store put the lock on the door
Just get away where your worries won't find you
If you like, well I'll tell you more
Don't let the day get the better of you
When the evening comes there's so much to do
You better put on your best and wear a smile
Just come along with me awhile, 'cause I tell you
I know a place where the music is fine
And the lights are always low
I know a place where we can go
At the door there's a man who will greet you
Then you go downstairs to some tables and chairs
Soon I'm sure you'll be tappin' your feet
Because the beat is the greatest there
All around there are girls and boys
It's a swingin' place, a cellar full of noise
It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow
You gotta come along right now 'cause I tell you
I know a place where the music is fine
And the lights are always low
I know a place where we can go
Well, all around there are girls and boys
It's a swingin' place, a cellar full of noise
It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow
You gotta come along right now 'cause I tell you
I know a place where the music is fine
And the lights are always low
I know a place where we can go
I know a place where we can go
I know a place where the lights are low
You gotta love this place I know
I know a place where we can go
