Well, I'll be doggone if I wouldn't work all day
And I'll be doggone if I wouldn't bring you my pay, baby
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, hey, I'd be long gone
Then I wouldn't be doggone (wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone, mm-hmm (I'd be long gone)
Now, hey, hey, hey
I'll be doggone if you ain't a pretty thing (baby)
And I'll be doggone if you ain't warm as a breath of spring (baby)
And if we live to be a hundred years old
If you ever let that spring turn cold
Then I wouldn't be doggone (wouldn't be doggone)
Hey, hey, hey, I'd be long gone (I'd be long gone)
Oh, I wouldn't be doggone (wouldn't be doggone))
Baby, I'd be long gone (I'd be long gone) mm-hmm
Now, did you hear me?
Well, now, what I say?
Oh, believe me
Well, every woman should try to be whatever her man wants her to be
And I don't want much, all I want from you is for you to be true to me
I'll be doggone if love ain't a man's best friend, oh baby (oh, baby)
And I'll be doggone if you ain't the loving end (baby)
Though I know you make me feel like nobody could
If I ever found out that you're no good
Then I wouldn't be doggone (wouldnt be, wouldn't be, wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone (I'd be long gone)
Well, I wouldn't be doggone (wouldn't be doggone)
I'd be long gone (I'd be long gone)
I wouldn't be doggone (wouldn't be doggone) catch me a train
(I'd be long gone) No baby, I wouldn't be doggone, I'm gonna catch me a train
