What's new pussycat whoa
What's new pussycat whoa oh
Pussycat, pussycat, I've got flowers
And lots of hours to spend time with you
So go and powder your cute little pussycat nose
Pussycat, pussycat, I love you yes I do
You and your pussycat nose
What's new pussycat whoa
What's new pussycat whoa oh oh
Pussycat, pussycat, you're so thrilling
And I'm so willing to care for you
So go and make up your big little pussycat eyes
Pussycat, pussycat, I love you yes I do
You and your pussycat eyes
What's new pussycat whoa
What's new pussycat whoa oh oh
Pussycat, pussycat, you're delicious
And if my wishes can all come true
I'll soon be kissing your sweet little pussycat lips
Pussycat, pussycat, I love you yes I do
You and your pussycat eyes whoa
You and your pussycat nose
