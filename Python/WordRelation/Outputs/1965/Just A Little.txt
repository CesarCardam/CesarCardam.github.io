56. Beau BrummelsIntroducing
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
I can't stay
Yes I know
You know I
Hate to go
But goodbye
Love was sweet
I was kind
Never mean
So I'll cry just a little cause I love you so
And I'll die just a little cause I have to go
Away...
Can't you see
How I feel
When I say
Love's unreal
So goodbye
It's been sweet
Even though
Incomplete
So I'll cry just a little cause I love you so
And I'll die just a little cause i have to go
Away...
Every night
I still hear
Oh your sigh's
Very near
Now it's gone
Gone away
As I once
Heard you say
Now I'll cry just a little cause I love you so
And I'll die just a little cause i have to go
Away...
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
