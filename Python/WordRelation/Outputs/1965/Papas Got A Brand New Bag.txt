33. James Brown & The Famous FlamesThe Godfather
Come here sister, Papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip, about that new breed babe
He ain't no drag
Papa's got a brand new bag
Come here mama, and dig this crazy scene
He's not too fancy, but his line is pretty clean
He ain't no drag.
Papa's got a brand new bag
He's doing the Jerk,
He's doing the Fly
Don't play him cheap 'cause you know he ain't shy
He's doing the Monkey, the Mashed Potatoes,
Jump back Jack, See you later alligator.
Come here sister
Papa's in the swing
He ain't too hip now
But I can dig that new breed babe;
He ain't no drag
He's got a brand new bag
