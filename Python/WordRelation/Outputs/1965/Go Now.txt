50. Moody BluesThe Magnificent Moodies
We've already said "Goodbye"
Since you gotta go, oh you'd better
Go now go now, go now (Go now)
Before you see me cry?
I don't want you to tell me just what you intend to do now
'Cause how many times do I have to tell you darlin', darlin'
I'm still in love with you now
Whoa oh oh oh
We've already said "So long"
I don't want to see you go, oh you'd better
Go now go now, go now (Go now)
Don't you even try?
Tellin' me that you really don't want it to end this way
'Cause darlin', darlin', can't you see I want you to stay.
Whoa oh oh oh
