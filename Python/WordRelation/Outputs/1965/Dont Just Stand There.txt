77. Patty DukeThe Complete Album Collection
Please don't just stand there
Come and kiss me like before
Please don't just stand there
Looking down at the floor
If something is wrong
Give me just one little sign
Is there someone else
Please tell me
Tell me what what what what's on your mind
Once when we'd meet
You'd run to hold me tight
Life was so sweet
Until tonight
Please don't just stand there
Get it over if we're through
Please don't just stand there
While my heart breaks in two
Don't be unfair
How can you be so unkind
Please stop hurting me
And help me
Tell me what what what what's on your mind
If it's a game
We don't want to play it
And if it's goodbye
Why can't you just say it
Why make me cry like you do
How can you be so unkind
Please start loving me
Or leave me
Tell me what what what what's on your mind
Don't just stand there
[Fade]
(Tell me what what what what's on your mind)
(Don't just stand there)
