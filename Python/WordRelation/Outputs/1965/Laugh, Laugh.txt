87. Beau BrummelsIntroducing
I hate to say it but I told you so, don't mind my preachin' to you
I said "don't trust him, baby" now you know
You don't learn ev'rything there is to know in school.
Wouldn't believe me when I gave advice, I said that he was a tease
If you want help you better ask me nice
So be sincere, convince me with a "pretty please"
Laugh, laugh, I thought I'd die
It seemed so funny to me
Laugh, laugh you met a guy who taught you how it feels to be
Lonely, oh so lonely
Don't think I'm bein' funny when I say you got just what you deserve
I can't help feeling you found out today
You thought you were too good you had a lot of nerve
Won't say I'm sorry for the things I said. I'm glad he packed up to go
You kept on braggin' he was yours instead
Found you don't know ev'rything there is to know
Laugh, laugh, I thought I'd die
It seemed so funny to me
Laugh, laugh you met a guy who taught you how it feels to be
Lonely, oh so lonely
Before I go I got to say one thing, don't close your ears to me
Take my advice and you find out that being
Just another girl won't cause you misery
Don't say you can get any boy to call, don't be so smug or else
You'll find you can't get any boy a'tall
You'll wind up an old lady sittin' on the shelf.
Laugh, laugh, I thought I'd die
It seemed so funny to me
Laugh, laugh you met a guy who taught you how it feels to be
Lonely, oh so lonely
Lonely, oh so lonely
