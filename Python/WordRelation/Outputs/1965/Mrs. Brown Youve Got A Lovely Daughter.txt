19. Herman's HermitsHermans Hermits/Theres a Kind of Hush All Over the World/Mrs. Brown You&#039;ve Got a Lovely Daughter
Mrs. Brown you've got a lovely daughter
Girls as sharp as her are somethin' rare
But it's sad, she doesn't love me now
She's made it clear enough it ain't no good to pine
She wants to return those things I bought her
Tell her she can keep them just the same
Things have changed, she doesn't love me now
She's made it clear enough it ain't no good to pine
Walkin' about, even in a crowd, well
You'll pick her out, makes a bloke feel so proud
If she finds that I've been round to see you (round to see you)
Tell her that I'm well and feelin' fine (feelin' fine)
Don't let on, don't say she's broke my heart
I'd go down on my knees but it's no good to pine
Walkin' about, even in a crowd, well
