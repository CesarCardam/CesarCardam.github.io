79. Brenda Leealbum
I wish I could come back to you, dear
'Cause I know that you want me too
But too much waters run under that old bridge
There's too many rivers between me and you
There's too many rivers to cross, dear
Too many dreams have been lost
And there's too many long nights that I've turned and tossed
There's too many rivers to cross
Now, don't think for a moment
I blame only you
We both peeled the fruit on the vine
And when you try to put love back together
There's always a few little pieces that you can't find
Yes, there's too many rivers to cross, dear
And there's too many dreams that have been lost
And there's too many long nights that I've turned and tossed
There's too many rivers to cross
