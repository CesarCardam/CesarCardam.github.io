85. Joe Texalbum
You'd better hold on, hold on to what you've got
You'd better hold on, hold on to what you've got
'Cause if you think nobody wants it
Just throw it away and you will see
Someone will have it before you can count one, two, three
Yes they will, yes they will
Listen fellows, you know it's not all the time
That a man can have a good woman
A women he can call his very own
A woman who will stay right there at home
And mind the children while he's gone to work
A woman who will have his dinner cooked
When he comes home
Where some men make mistakes is
When they go out and stay because they feel
That no other man wants his woman but him??
But listen, if you think no other man wants her
Just throw her away and you will see
Some men will have her before you can count one, two, three
Yes he will, yes he will
Listen girls, this goes for you too
Because you know I've seen so many women who've had so many good men in life
Men who would stand by them through thick and thin
Men who'd go to work everyday and
Bring home their hard earned pay
Men who'd give their woman anything
That their little hearts desired
Where some women make mistakes is
When their men go out and let 'em play they would stay
Because they felt that no other woman wanted him but her
Listen, if you think no other woman wants him
Just pitch him out in the street and you will see
Some woman will have your man
Before you can count one, two, three
Yes she will, yes she will
