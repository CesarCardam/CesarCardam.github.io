I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And he's taking just all that I had
But if you wanna try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worse
I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
But I'm sure gonna give you a try
If you wanna try to love again
Try,
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worse
I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
But I'm sure gonna give you a try
'Cause if you wanna try to love again
(Try to love again, try to love again)
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worse
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
(Try to love again)
