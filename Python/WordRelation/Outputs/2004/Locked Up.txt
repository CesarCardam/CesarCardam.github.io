44. Akon Featuring Styles P.Trouble
I'm steady tryna find a motive,
Why do what I do?,
Freedom ain't gettin' no closer,
No matter how far I go,
My car is stolen, no registration,
Cops patrollin', and now they done stop me,
And I get locked up,
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
Headin' up town to re-up
Back with a couple of keys
Corner blocks on fire,
Under covers dressed as fiends,
Makin' so much money,
Ride up smooth and fast,
Put away the stash,
And as I sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
'Cause visitation no longer comes by,
Seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is gettin' empty
My cell mates gettin' food wit out me
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life,
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
Maybe a visit (they won't let me out)
Send me some magazines (they won't let me out)
Send me some money orders (they won't let me out, no)
Maybe a visit baby (they won't let me out)
'cause I'm locked up, they won't let me out.
Where's my lawyer? (they won't let me out)
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, no.
Get me outta here (they won't let me out)
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, they won't let me out.
Baby I'm locked up they won't let me out, no
Where's my niggaz?
On the lock-down.
Damn, I'm locked up, they won't let me out.
I'm locked up, they won't let me out.
Oh they won't let me out.
Can you please accept my phone calls?
'Cause I'm locked up, locked up, locked up.
