30. Nelly Featuring Jaheimalbum
I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand anything I'm offering
I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguing
From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again
Even if flipped out on me at the mall again
"It's all his fault again" that's what you telling all ya friends
I ain't pointing no fingers ma, I just want to call again
See how ya day going, I know they stressing on ya I know them times
Get hard that's why I'm checking on ya
It's yours truly ma, I got little message for ya anything he can do,
Girl I can do better for ya Cause
Cause When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We goin' still be as one it's forever, it's forever
Won't you come on and go with me (oh girl) Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat and let me ease ya mind girl
We gon' do it our way (our way)
I heard your friend tell a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time
This ain't the truth then hopefully it's not a lie
Cause I ain't got no issue with hitting that another time
We never had a problem with getting it done
Disagreed upon a lot ma, but the sex wouldn't one
Now check it I know you get excited when I come around and bite it
Quit frowning up and quit acting like you don't like it
I like it (I know you like), I like it (You really like it),
I really, really like it, I want it (You really want it), adore it (adore it)
So come let me enjoy it
So come let me enjoy it
Cause When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We goin' still be as one it's forever, it's forever
Won't you come on and go with me (oh girl) Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat and let me ease ya mind girl
We gon do it our way (our way)
Shawty where you been
Feels like a long time, long long time since I seen ya
Yes it has girl,
And I know I said some dumb things to you before
But girl you know I didn't mean it
I didn't mean one single word I never meant one single word
(I didn't mean one single word, I didn't mean one single word)
If I could take back every word I would and
more for sure If I thought that you believe it
Cause you make my life so convenient for me
Cause When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We goin' still be as one it's forever, it's forever
Won't you come on and go with me (oh girl) Come on over to my place
Won't you sit ya self down and take a seat and let me ease ya mind girl
We gon do it our way (our way)
I like it (I know you like), I like it (You really like it)
I really, really like it,
I want it (You really want it), adore it (adore it)
so come let me enjoy it
I like it (I know you like), I like it (You really like it)
I really, really like it,
I want it (You really want it), adore it (adore it)
so come let me enjoy it
Cause When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We goin' still be as one it's forever, it's forever
