97. Gretchen WilsonHere For The Party
Well I ain't never
Been the barbie doll type
No I can't swig that sweet champagne
I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern or in a honky tonk
I want a four wheel drive tailgate
I've got posters on my wall of Skynrd, Kid and Straight
Some people look down on me
But I don't give a rip
I stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby on my hip
'Cause I'm redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my rasin'
And I say "hey y'all" and "Yee Haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me give a big "Hell Yea" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Victoria's Secret
Well their stuff's real nice
Oh but I can buy the same damn thing on a WalMart shelf half price
And still look sexy
Just as sexy
As those models on TV
No I don't need no designer tag to make my man want me
You might think I'm trashy
A little too hard core
But get in my neck of the woods
I'm just the girl next door
Hey I'm redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my rasin'
And I say "hey y'all" and "Yee Haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big "Hell Yeah" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
I'm redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my rasin'
And I say "hey y'all" and "Yee Haw"
And I keep my Christmas lights on my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Ol' Bo Seafus song
So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me give a big "Hell Yeah" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
Hell yeah
I said hell yeah
