I've been waiting all day for ya babe
So won't you come sit and talk to me
And tell me how we're gonna be together always
Hope you know that when this late at night
I hold on to a pillow tight
I think about how you promised me forever
I never thought that anyone could make me feel this way
Now that you're here boy all I want is just a chance to say
Get out (leave) right now
It's the end of you and me
It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone
'Cause I know about her (who)
And I wonder (why) how I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right
But you were just a waste of time (waste of time)
Tell me why you looking so confused
When I'm the one that didn't know the truth
How could you ever be so cold?
You go behind my back and call my friend
Boy you must've fall and bumped your head
'Cause you left your number on her phone
So now that after all that you've said and done
Maybe I'm the one to blame but
To think that you could be the one
Well it didn't work out that way
Get out (leave) right now
It's the end of you and me
It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone (you to be gone)
'Cause I know about her (move)
And I wonder (why) how I bought all the lies (all the lies)
You said that you would treat me right (you said that you)
But you were just a waste of time (waste of time)
I wanted you right here with me
But I have no choice you've got to leave
Because my heart is breaking with
Every word I'm saying, I gave up everything I had
On something that just would not last
But I refuse to cry
No tears will fall from these eyes (oh, oh)
Get out
Get out (leave) right now
It's the end of you and me (you and me)
It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone (you to be gone)
'Cause I know about her (move)
And I wonder (why) how I bought all the lies (how did I)
You said that you would treat me right (you said that you)
But you were just a waste of time (waste of time)
Get out (leave) right now
It's the end of you and me (hey yeah)
It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone (you to be gone)
'Cause I know about her (move)
And I wonder (why) how I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right (treat me right)
But you were just a waste of time (waste of time)
Get out (leave) (you and me)
It's too late (too late) (now)
About her (now) (why)
You said that you would treat me right
But you were just a waste of time (oh)
