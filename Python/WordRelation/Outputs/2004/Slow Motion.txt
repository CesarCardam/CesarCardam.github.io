Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jicky jerking
Slow down for me you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping I'm trying to grip that ass
Keep being hard headed and I'ma make you get of me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy

Fine bitches if you listening you heard me I'm strong

Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together I ain't jiving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do ya know
And juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby

Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping that she don't leave my dick broken
With brush burns and swollen

I guarantee ya I'ma see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'ma deal with ya
I like how that Victoria secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handful
I know what's happening all I want is a sample
Who you wit I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit the more for the we
