My milk shake brings all the boys to the yard,
And there like,
Its better than yours,
Damn right its better than yours,
I can teach you,
But I have to charge
I know you want it,
The thing that makes me,
What the guys go crazy for.
They lose their minds,
The way I wind,
I think its time
La la-la la la,
Warm it up.
Lala-lalala,
The boys are waiting
My milk shake brings all the boys to the yard,
And there like,
Its better than yours,
Damn right its better than yours,
I can teach you,
But I have to charge
I can see you're on it,
You want me to teach the
Techniques that freaks these boys,
It can't be bought,
Just know, thieves get caught,
Watch if your smart,
La la-la la la,
Warm it up,
La la-la la la,
The boys are waiting,
My milk shake brings all the boys to the yard,
And there like,
Its better than yours,
Damn right its better than yours,
I can teach you,
But I have to charge
Once you get involved,
Everyone will look this way-so,
You must maintain your charm,
Same time maintain your halo,
Just get the perfect blend,
Plus what you have within,
Then next his eyes are squint,
Then he's picked up your scent,
Lala-lalala,
Warm it up,
Lala-lalala,
The boys are waiting,
My milk shake brings all the boys to the yard,
And there like,
Its better than yours,
Damn right its better than yours,
I can teach you,
But I have to charge.
