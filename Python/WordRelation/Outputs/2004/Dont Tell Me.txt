92. Avril LavigneUnder My Skin
You held my hand and walked me home,I know
While you gave me that kiss you were something like this
It made me go ooh ooh
You wiped my tears got rid of all my fears
Why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love
Guys are so hard to trust
Did I not tell you that I'm not like that
Girl, the one who gives it all away?
Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time?
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do,and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
You're better off that way
