88. Black Eyed PeasLet&#039;s Get It Started 1
And the bass keeps runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin'
And runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin'
And runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin'
And runnin' runnin' and runnin' runnin' and
In this context, there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme
You break yo necks
We got 5 minutes for this to disconnect
From all intellect and let the rhythm effect
Apt to lose this inhibition
Follow your intuition
Free your inner soul
And break away from tradition
Cause when we be out
Girl it's gonna be that
You wouldn't believe how
Wow shit out
Burnin' till it's burned out
Turn it till it's turned out
Act up from north, west, east, south
Everybody, (yeah) everybody, (yeah) lets get into it, (yeah) get stupid
(come on)Get started, (come on)get started, (yeah) get started
Lets get started in hah, lets get started in here
Lets get started in hah, lets get started in here
Lets get started in hah, lets get started in here
Lets get started in hah, lets get started in here
Lose control, all body, all soul
Don't move to fast, people just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Y'all hit a body, the Peas'll do it
Get started, get stupid,
Don't worry bout it people we'll walk you through it
Step by step, like if you're in for new kid
Inch by inch, with the new solution
Transmit hits, with no delusion
The feelings irresistible and that's how we move it
C'mon!
Everybody, (yeah) everybody, (yeah) lets get into it, (yeah) get stupid

Lets get started in hah, lets get started in here

Up inside your club, or in your Bentley
