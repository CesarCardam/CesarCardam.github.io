Oh move your body girl makes the fellaz go
It's the way you ride it girl makes the fellaz go
Oh move your body girl makes the fellaz go
It's the way you ride it girl makes the fellaz go
All up in the club looking fly
Made your 1st approach then caught his eye
So we move our way towards the dance floor
Grabbed her hand then she whispered
Whole night has gotten through
stand behind me let me crack a groove
I lick my lips while I'm feeling you
Now I'm going to make you go
Oh move your body girl makes the fellaz go
It's the way you ride it girl makes the fellaz go
Oh move your body girl makes the fellaz go
It's the way you ride it girl makes the fellaz go
Wow (your feelin it now) take it slow (you turning me on)
Club gets warmer (warmer) bodies move closer (closer)
Gone wit the rhythm don't stop moving your making me HOT
From head to toe I feel your flow
Thighs get stronger (stronger) party seems longer (Longer)
Make me really want ya
Don't stop movin your making me HOT
Oh move your body girl makes the fellaz go
It's the way you ride it girl makes the fellaz go
Oh move your body girl makes the fellaz go
It's the way you ride it girl makes the fellaz go
Oh move your body girl makes the fellaz go
It's the way you ride it girl makes the fellaz go
Oh move your body girl makes the fellaz go
It's the way you ride it girl makes the fellaz go
Can your feel the beat (can ya can ya feel the beat)
Can your feel the beat (can ya can ya feel the beat)
Can you feel the beat within my heart can't you see my love shine through the dark
Can ya feel the beat
Can you feel the beat within my heart can't you see my love shine through the dark
can't you see that you must be apart of that beat in my heart
Oh move your body girl makes the fellaz go
It's the way you ride it girl makes the fellaz go
Oh move your body girl makes the fellaz go
It's the way you ride it girl makes the fellaz go
Oh move your body girl makes the fellaz go
It's the way you ride it girl makes the fellaz go
Oh move your body girl makes the fellaz go
It's the way you ride it girl makes the fellaz go
