16. Twista Featuring Kanye West & Jamie FoxxKamikaze
Are you gonna be? Say that you're gonna be
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
It definitely will
You know what I told her
I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
I'ma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbing me, calling me Biggie like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lying though?
Telling me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played 'ready for the world', she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak , so you bout to prove my man wrong
I'ma lay this Vandross, you gon take yo pants off
I'ma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon get right
She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down
It's good, it's all good, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster baby, can you please - do it faster, do it
Faster
Damn baby, I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can, Twista!
When I catch you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm laying back smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you when I'm messing wit Kan man and Twist in the Chi
And I be sipping hennessey, play some R&B
While I smoke a b - you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all this (well well well well)
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light, move it to some Isaac
His rims still moving so I bump a lil Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b - dipping through the streets
Bumping r&b, and I got the leaf, on the 23's
And I do it (well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling her wit every temptation, slow jam, and havin deep sex
You ready for the world girl, baby come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment controlling me
I love the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumping Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'ma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's r&b, come to the club wit me
And when some Luther come on I hope you feeling me
And still will be in love wit me
She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)

Some Minnie Ripperton will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
