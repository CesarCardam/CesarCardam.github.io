39. Ashlee SimpsonAutobiography
On a Monday I am waiting
Tuesday I am fading
And By Wednesday I can't sleep
Then the phone rings I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
Cause you've come to rescue me
Fall, with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath
I hope it lasts
It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
It's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
I am moody and messy
I get restless and it's senseless
How you never seem to care
When I'm angry, you listen
Make me happy, its your mission
And you won't stop till I'm there
Fall, sometimes I fall so fast
When I hit that bottom crash
You're all I have
It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
It's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
How do you know?
Everything I'm about to say
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face
I hope it never goes away
Yea
On a Monday I am waiting
By Tuesday I am fading
Into your arms
So I can breathe
It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
It's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
I love how you can tell
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me
Pieces, pieces, pieces of me
