98. EminemCurtain Call
OK
Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop
Pajama time
Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap
As in a new case of child molestation accusation
Aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise
I done touched on everything, but little boys
And that's not a stab at Micheal
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
Give a little "poot poot", it's OK (Fart Sound)
Oops my C-D just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass,
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
Now you know you're my world
Alright now lose it
Aah aah aah aah aah
Just lose it
Aah aah aah aah aah
Go crazy
Aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby
Aah aah
Oh baby baby aah aah
It's Friday and it's my day
Chance to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway
Feelin' kinda breezy
Get the top down, let my hair blow
I dunno where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there
Someones gonna touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
Now what's your name girl
What's your sign
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre aah aah
Beer goggles, blind
I'm just trying to unwind
Now I'm
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass,
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
Now you know you're my world
Alright now lose it
Aah aah aah aah aah
Just lose it
Aah aah aah aah aah
Go crazy
Aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby
Aah aah
Oh baby baby aah aah
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was running butt naked
Down the street screaming
Aah aah aah aah aah
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much
I'm not guilty
They said save it boy
We got you on tape
Telling an old lady to "touch my body"
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now step back to reality
Look it's B.Rabbit
You signed me up to battle?
I'm a grown man
Chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba
I don't have any lines to go right here so
Duba duba teletubie fella's what? fella's yeah?
Grab you left (nut), make right one jealous what?
Black girls
White girls
Skinny girls
Fat girls
Tall girls
Small girls
I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezing it's the season
Just go aah aah aah aah
It's so appeasin'
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass,
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
Now you know you're my world
Alright now lose it
Aah aah aah aah aah
Just lose it
Aah aah aah aah aah
Go crazy
Aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby
Aah aah
Oh baby baby aah aah
