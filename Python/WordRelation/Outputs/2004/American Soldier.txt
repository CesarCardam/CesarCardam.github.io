I'm just trying to be a father,
Raise a daughter and a son,
Be a lover to their mother,
Everything to everyone.
Up and at 'em bright and early,
I'm all business in my suit,
Yeah,I'm dressed up for success,
From my head down to my boots.
I don't do it for money
There's bills that I can't pay.
I don't do it for the glory,
I just do it anyway.
Providing for our future's my responsibility,
Yeah I'm real good under pressure,
Being all that I can be.
And I can't call in sick on Mondays
When the weekends been too strong,
I just work straight through the holidays,
And sometimes all night long.
You can bet that I stand ready
When the wolf growls at the door,
Hey, I'm solid, hey I'm steady,
Hey I'm true down to the core.
And I will always do my duty,
No matter what the price,
I've counted up the cost,
I know the sacrifice.
Oh, and I don't want to die for you,
But if dyin's asked of me,
I'll bear that cross with honor,
'Cause freedom don't come free.
I'm an American soldier, an American,
Beside my brothers and my sisters
I will proudly take a stand,
When liberty's in jeopardy
I will always do what's right,
I'm out here on the front lines,
So you can sleep in peace tonight.
American soldier, I'm an American,
