25. Chingy Featuring J. WeavJackpot
Yeah yeah, DTP, how we do, call you, you can call me
Whatever you want to do baby, come on
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my baby) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my lady) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my baby) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my lady) I'm only one call away
It was weird how we met, huh?
She was with her mom at Bank of America
I'm with my son cashing a check, so I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world or fly, we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye, momma looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about his girls style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual walks through the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinking smart
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, clutch and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up
We could talk, conversate about political subjects, whatever starts
So I zoomed off thinkin' bout her, my phone rang
It was her in the shower (what did she say?)
She said I couldn't do without you Then I say
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my baby) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my lady) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my baby) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my lady) I'm only one call away
The next day I'm with the fellas at the case playin ball
Here she come with her friends they posted up on the wall
Now I'm showin' off, tryin' to dunk, tryin' to dribble
Break fast threw the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying Lil Howard you weak
But you know how that go, what I got they want
What I got I flaunt, never mess with it please don't
Told her I'm goin home she asked can she go too
I'm like yeah boo, I can't see me without you
Got thurr I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-threw thong on looked at her and I said
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my baby) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my lady) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my baby) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my lady) I'm only one call away
Girl recognize game before game recognize you
You dealin' with a playa, true, now what you wanna do
We can kick it and go puff on a blunt
Oh you don't smoke? Grab a pint of henn and we can get drunk
Its up to you, I'm the man but baby just let me know
'Cause if you got a attitude then I could treat you just like a ho
If ya rollin with me baby hop in its enough room
We can gaze at the stars and shine like the moon
Give me a chance to show ya and a chance to know ya
Just be true and theres nothing I won't do for ya
Some women like to play it foul
But them the kind I put in a place like a child
Don't worry be happy and smile
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my baby) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my lady) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my baby) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my lady) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my baby) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my lady) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my baby) I'm only one call away
(You could roll with me) Give me a call if you wanna come roll with me
(If you was my lady) I'm only one call away
