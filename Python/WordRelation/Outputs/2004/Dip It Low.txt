23. Christina MilianIt&#039;s About Time
Says he wants you
He says he needs you
It's real talking
Why not make him wait for you
If he really wants you
If he really needs you
Really got to have you
Take your time and feel him out
When it's a good boy
I mean a really really good boy
Why not let him lay with you
That's when you give it to him good
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out like your back broke
Pop pop pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say "Ooh"
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out like your back broke
Pop pop pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say "Ooh"
You getting bold
He growin' cold
It's just the symptoms of young love
Growin' old
You think it's time
And your thinking of leaving
But give it time
It's late at night
He's coming home
Meet him at the door with nothin' on
Take him by the hair
Let him know what's on
If you understand me
Y'all come on
All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move (move)
All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you want to do (show her what you got daddy)
All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move
All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you want to do (oh, whoa oh)
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out like your back broke
Pop pop pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say "Ooh"
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out like your back broke
Pop pop pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say "Ooh"
We can move
If you want to
We can move
If you want to
We can move
If you want to
We can move
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out like your back broke
Pop pop pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say "Ooh"
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out like your back broke
Pop pop pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say "Ooh"
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out like your back broke
Pop pop pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say "Ooh"
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out like your back broke
Pop pop pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say "Ooh"
