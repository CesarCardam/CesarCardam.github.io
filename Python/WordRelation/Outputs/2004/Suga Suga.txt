46. Baby Bash Featuring Frankie JTha Smokin&#039; Nephew
So tight, so fly
You got me lifted, you got me lifted
You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceilin'
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watching screens getting high
Girl you keep it so fly with your sweet honey buns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes
Off top I can't lie I love to get blowed
You my lil' sugar, I'm yo little chulo
And every time we kick it it's off to the groovy
Treat you like my sticky icky or my sweet ooy gooy (For real though)
You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Now I ain't worried about a thang 'cause I just hit me a lick
I got a fat sack and a super fly chick
There ain't nothing you can say to a playa'
'Cause doo-wop, she fly like the planes in the air
That's right she's full grown settin' the wrong tone
I'm diggin' the energy and I'm lovin' the ozone
So fly like a dove, fly like a raven
Quick to politic with some fly conversation
In a natural mood then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools blowin' out by the pool
She like my sexy cool mama, we'll blaze on the Barada
Rockin' Dolce & Gabbana, hydro in a Cubana
You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watching screens getting high
Girl you keep it so fly with your sweet honey buns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes
You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watching screens getting high
Girl you keep it so fly with your sweet honey buns
You was there when the money gone
You'll be there when the money comes (For real though)
You got me lifted shifted higher than a ceiling
And ooh wee it's the ultimate feeling
You got me lifted feeling so gifted
Sugar how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
Suga suga how you get so fly?
So high like I'm a star
So high like I'm a star
So high like I'm a star
So high like I'm a star
