29. Alicia KeysThe Diary Of Alicia Keys
Baby, baby, baby
From the day I saw you
Really, really wanted to catch your eye
Somethin' special 'bout you
I must really like you
'Cause not a lot of guys are worth my time, ooh
Oh baby, baby, baby
It's getting kind of crazy
'Cause you are taking over my mind
And it feels like ooh
You don't know my name
I swear, it feels like ooh
You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)
Oh, baby, baby, baby
I see us on our first date
Doing everything that makes me smile
When we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Ooh it set my soul on fire
Ooh baby, baby, baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's running wild
It feels like ooh
You don't know my name
And I swear it baby, it feels like ooh
You don't know my name
(Round and round and round we go, will you ever know)
I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doin' to me
Got me feelin' all crazy inside
I'm feelin' like, oh
Doing nothing I've ever done
For anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
'Cause did I mention (oh)
You bout' to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels
To have, all my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience, my lovin' (oh)
'Cause my lovin' feels like
Ooh
You don't know my name
And I swear it feels like
Ooh
You don't my name
You don't know my name
Baby, baby I swear
It's like
Ooh
You don't know my name
It feels like
Ooh
And you don't my name
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like
Ooh
Ooh
Will you ever know?
