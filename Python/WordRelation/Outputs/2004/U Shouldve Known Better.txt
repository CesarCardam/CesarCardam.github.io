I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico
I really didn't need the shopping sprees in L.A. and Melrose
Boy if you didn't know it, well now you know
I didn't need the furs or the jewelry
Because material things they don't mean much to me
And ever since you've been gone
I've been holding us down on my own
You know
I never ever cheated
I never ever lied
So you can stop asking
Asking me why
Why I never left you
And why I've kept it real
And why I'm still with you
You should've known better than to think I would leave
You should've known better than to doubt me
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side
You should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter if you're rich or poor
Out here doing five to ten
You should've known better
What makes you think that I would forget about you
Think about it, who comes to see you
Every Saturday and Monday I was on that receiver
It's me your girl, your life, your world
My family and friends, they just don't understand
They say I should leave you alone
But I say that they should all just leave us alone
Don't you get it?
I never every cheated
I never ever lied
So you can stop asking
Asking me why
Why I never left you
And why I've kept it real
And why I'm still with you
You should've known better than to think I would leave
You should've known better than to doubt me
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side
You should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter if you're rich or poor
Out here doing five to ten
You should've known better
You should've known better than to think I would leave
You should've known better than to doubt me
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side
You should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter if you're rich or poor
Out here doing five to ten
You should've known better
