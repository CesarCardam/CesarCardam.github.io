I'm in the club with my homies, try'na get a lil' v-I
Keep it down on the low key, 'cause you know how it feels
I said shawty she was checkin' up on me
From the game she was spittin' my ear you'd think that she knew me
So we decided to chill
Conversation got heavy
She had me feelin' like she's ready to blow (watch out oh, watch out)
She saying come get me, come get me
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said baby lets go, when I told her I said
Yeah (yeah) shawty got down an' said come and get me
Yeah (yeah) I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah (yeah) Her and my girl would be the best of homies
Yeah (yeah) next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Shes all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might good idea to take her with me
'Cause she's ready to leave
Now I gotta keep it real now
'Cause on a one-to-ten she's a certified twenty, and that just ain't me
'Cause I do know if I take that chance just where is it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance makes shawty alright with me
The way she getting low

Luda', watch out my outfit's ridiculous
In the club lookin' so conspicuous
And rowl! these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady I'm a milk the cow
Forget about the game I'm a spit the truth,
I won't stop till I get em in they birthday suits
So gimmie the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put em on foot patrol
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Lets drank you the one to please
Ludacris fill cups like double D's
Me and Ush once more and we leave em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say
Yeah (yeah) shawty got down an' said come and get me
Yeah (yeah) I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah (yeah) Her and my girl would be the best of homies
Yeah (yeah) next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming
