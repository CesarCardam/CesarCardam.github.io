07. Mario Winans Featuring Enya & P. Diddyalbum
I just can't believe this man
Just another night of these thoughts
Can't get this outta my head, yeah
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
Cuz my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
Oh baby
I think about it when I hold you
When looking in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
Cuz my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
Did he touch you better than me
Did he watch you fall asleep
Did you show him all those things
That you used to do to me
If you're better off that way
Baby all that I can say
If you're gonna do your thing
Then don't come back to me
I don't wanna know your whereabouts or how you movin
I know when you in the house or when you cruisin
Its been proven, my love you abusin
I can't understand how a man got you choosin (yeah)
Undecided I came and provided, my undivided
You came and denied it (why?)
Don't even try it, I know when you lyin (i know when you lyin)
Don't even do that
I know why you cryin (stop cryin)
I'm not applyin no pressure, just wanna let you know
That I don't wanna let you go (i don't wanna let you go)
And I don't wanna let you leave
Can't say I didn't let you breathe
Gave you extra cheese(c'mon) put you in the SUV
You wanted ice so I made you freeze
Made you hot like the west indies (that's right)
Now its time you invest in me
Cause if not then its best you leave
Holla yeah
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
Cuz my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
Cuz my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
