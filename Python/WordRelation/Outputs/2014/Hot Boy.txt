54. Bobby Shmurdaalbum
And Chewy, I'm some hot n****
Like I talk to Shyste when I shot n****s
Like you seen em twirl then he drop, n****
And we keep them 9 milli's on my block, n****
And Monte keep it on him, he done dropped n****s
And Trigger he be wilding, he some hot n****
Tones known to get busy with them Glocks, n****
Try to run down and you can catch a shot, n****
Running through these checks till' I pa** out
Your shawty gave me neck 'til I pa** out
I swear to God, all I do is cash out
And if you ain't a ho, get up out my trap house
I been selling crack since like the 5th grade
Really never made no difference what the s*** made
Jaja taught me flip them packs and how to maintain
Get that money back and spend it on the same thing
Shawty like the way that I ball out
I be getting money till' I fall out
You talking cash dog, I goes all out
Shawty love the way that I floss out
Free Greezy though, let all of my dogs out
Mama said no p**** cats inside my dog house
That's what got my daddy locked up in the dog pound
Free Phantom though, let all of my dogs out
We gon' pull up in that hooptie like we cops on 'em
With the 16's, we gon' put some shots on em'
I send a lil' thot to send the drop on em'
She gon' call me up and I'mma sick the hots on em'
Grimey savage, that's what we are
Grimey shooters dressed in G-Star
GS9, I go so hard
But GS for my gun squad
And b**** if there's a problem we gon' gun brawl
Shots poppin 'out The AR
I'm with Trigger, I'm with Rasha, I'm with A-Raw
Broad daylight and we gon' let them things bark
Tell them n****s free Meechie Ho
Someway free Breezy ho
And tell my n****s, Shmurda teaming, ho
Mitch caught a body 'bout a week ago
F*** with us and then we tweaking, ho
Run up on that n**** get to squeezing, ho
Everybody catching bullet holes
N****s got me on my bully yo
I'mma run up, put that gun on 'em
I'mma run up, go dumb on 'em
N****s got me on that young s***
Got me on that go dumb s***
