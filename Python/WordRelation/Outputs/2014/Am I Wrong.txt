14. Nico & Vinzalbum
[Verse 1]
Everything you want to know
Long enough to be alive.
How could it be expected
To feel the way you do? Yea
I feel like I'm fading!
Farther away from you
How could it be expected
To remember all the good things, the good things, the good things that you've done?
[Chorus]
You are, the potter, I'm the clay.
You are, the only way.
I am, your child today.
I am your servant, won't you teach me how to pray?
[Verse 2]
How many things I've spoken,
How many things I've done,
But all the things that have come my way
Have led me to be broken! Yea
Well who said life is fair?
But why was I chosen,
To be the thorn on all the roses?
I don't deserve this kind of life.
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Yeah Life is crime, but to fight is sin.
Life is dust, you never win.
Life is crime, but to fight is sin.
Life is dust, you never win.
You never win! yea!
Oh oh oh
You never win yea
You could never win.
Oh, you could never win.
[Chorus]
