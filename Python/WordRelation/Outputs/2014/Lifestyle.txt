72. Rich Gang Featuring Young Thug & Rich Homie Quanalbum
I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom, to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga livin' life like beginners
And this is only the beginnin'
I'm on the top of the mountain
Puffin' on clouds and niggas still beginnin'
Million 5 on the Visa card
Hundred bands still look like the fuckin' tires
Nigga servin' great white like I'm feedin' sharks
I won't do nothin' with the bitch, she can't even get me hard
Somethin' wrong with the pussy
Even though I ain't gon' hit it, I'ma still make sure that she douche it
Me and my rollie, we don't get caught up like that, no way
We ain't got time to go see doctors, J
(Who said money?)
Hop up in my bed full of forty bitches and yawnin'
Hey, this a show bitch you performin'
I do this shit for my daughters and all my sons, bitch
Hop on a random bands, I'll take out their funds, bitch
I got a moms bitch, she got a moms bitch
I got sisters and brothers to feed
I ain't goin' out like no idiot, I'm a OG
I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom, to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga livin' life like volcano
And this is only the beginnin'
I'm on the top of the mountain
Puffin' on clouds and niggas still beginnin'
Still screamin' "Fuck the otherside"
I'ma ride for my niggas, aye
And I'ma die for my niggas, aye
Ain't gonna be latching on my niggas boy
Niggas couldn't see me if they had a genie
I'ma live my life like Beanie, R.I.P. my brother Beanie
I stack my racks to the ceiling, now these niggas can't beat me
I just might wake up when Chanel and these bitches can't see me
I'm in a whole other league
I ain't got aids but I swear to God I would bleed
'Til I D.I.E
28 floors up I feel like I could F.L.Y.E.E
Pee on top of these bitches
God told me they can never stop me so they ain't gon' stop me
I'm in that coffin with baby mommy gettin' sloppy toppy
I'm bleedin' red like a devil, I see these bitches plotting
They wanna know how I got M's and I ain't finish college
I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom, to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga livin' life like volcano
And this is only the beginnin'
I'm on the top of the mountain
Puffin' on clouds and niggas still beginnin'
I do it for my daddy, I do it for my mama
Them long nights, I swear to God I do it for the come up
And well I be beating on my chest, in the jungle, aye
Money on money, I got commas in every bank
Sunday through Monday I've been grindin' with no sleep
Talkin' 'bout takin' somethin' from me, like no way
Thugger Thugger, that's my brother, brother
You don't want no trouble trouble or you can get these fists, knuckle knuckle
Buckle up like a seatbelt or I'll shoot yah
Punchin' on the gas, too fast, and I lose yah
Give me a bed, I'll do her, I want a head, Medusa
I swear a nigga gone cause this strong I'm blowin' super
Grindin' for a new day
I'm skatin', like that nigga Lupe
Hey, I'm on the top just like toupee
Hey, I'm in her mouth just like toothpaste
I've done did a lot of shit just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom, to the top, my lifestyle
Nigga livin' life like volcano
And this is only the beginnin'
I'm on the top of the mountain
Puffin' on clouds and niggas still beginnin'
