45. Justin TimberlakeThe 20/20 Experience Part 2
Said all I want from you
Is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow
Maybe you'll let me borrow, your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
An while we're at it throw in every other day to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife and you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby you're worth it
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me
'Cause I know that's a good place to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
Then someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
Don't you know that I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
Cause baby you're worth it
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just find out my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
No I won't fill your mind with broken promises
And wasted time
And if you fall
You'll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine
Don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
If I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And you'd put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
Now I know I can't save you
From the troubles of the world
And this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could I'd fly you away
On a big old pair of wings
And if I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And we'd fly so high up in the sky
Where the stars are so clear
And then I could save you
From the troubles of the world
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big old pair of wings
We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
But if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
If I had a pair of wings
I'd scoop you up we'd fly away and disappear
Then you could put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
And I know I can't save you
From the troubles of the world
I know this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could I'd fly you away
On a big old pair of wings
Now if I had a pair of wings
I'd pick you up and fly you far away from here
And I could stay right by your side and keep you so near
And then I could save you form the troubles of the world
And all you'd have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big old pair of wings
We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It's so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
And if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
And if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
I said if I had one wish I know what I'd wish for
There's only one thing that'll do
I'd fly away on this pair of wings with you
