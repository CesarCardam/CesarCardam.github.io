75. The NeighbourhoodI Love You.
And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand in California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves on my sweater
Lets have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts
Oh, she knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirts, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing I really wanna tell you about no
'Cause it's too cold, whoa
For you here
And now, so let me hold, whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides your mind
So move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to race
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love to taste yeah
These hearts adore, everyone the other beat heart is for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirts, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing I really wanna tell you about, no no no
'Cause it's too cold, whoa
For you here
And now, so let me hold, whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold, whoa
For you here
And now, so let me hold, whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa whoa
Whoa, whoa whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa whoa
Whoa, whoa
'Cause it's too cold, whoa
For you here
And now, so let me hold, whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
It's too cold, whoa
For you here
And now, so let me hold, whoa
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
It's too cold, it's too cold
The hands of my sweater
