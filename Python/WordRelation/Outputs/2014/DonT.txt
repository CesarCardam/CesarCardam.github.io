I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time, for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you can swing by my room around ten
Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
Well be in between the sheets 'till the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said
She's singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
For a couple of weeks I only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what its about
Maybe well go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him how
I was confused about
She should figure it out
Why I'm sat here singing
Don't with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told you
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize that you want it
It's a bit too much too late if I'm honest
And all this time God knows I'm singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
