84. Lady Gaga Featuring R. KellyARTPOP
[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I, I feel good
I walk alone
But then I trip over myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm OK
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream
[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
So do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
Don't stop, let's party
Do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
What you want with my body
Write what you want
Say what you want about me
If you're wondering
Know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want
What you want with my body
What you want with my body
[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart, and
You won't use my mind but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want (with my body)
You can't stop my voice, cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want (with my body)
[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Early morning, longer nights
Tom Ford, private flights
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in, cause it's our life
(Let's slow it down)
I could be the drink in your cup
I could be the green in your blunt
Your pusher man
Yeah I got what you want
You want to escape
All of the crazy shit
You're Marilyn, I'm the president
And I love to hear you sing, girl
[Pre-Chorus 2: R. Kelly]
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Back of the club, taking shots, getting naughty
No invitations, it's a private party
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Yeah we taking these haters and we roughing em up
And we lay in the club like we don't give a fuck
[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart, and
You won't use my mind but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want (with my body)
You can't stop my voice, cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want (with my body)
[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Sometimes I'm scared I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart
If you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party
[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can't have my heart, and
You won't use my mind but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want (with my body)
You can't stop my voice, cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want (with my body)
[Outro until fade: Lady Gaga]
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, girl
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, girl
Help me now
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body...
