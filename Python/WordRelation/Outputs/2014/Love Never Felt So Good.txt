78. Michael Jackson & Justin TimberlakeXscape
Baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it
'Cause baby, every time I love you
It's in and out of my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, in out baby
'Cause baby, love never felt so good
Baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd doubt if it was ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it cause
Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, driving me crazy
Baby, love never felt so good
Baby, love never felt so fine
And I'd doubt it was mine all mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it cause
Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, driving me crazy
Baby, love never felt so good
