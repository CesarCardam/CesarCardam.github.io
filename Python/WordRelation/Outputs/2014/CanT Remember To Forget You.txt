85. Shakira Featuring RihannaShakira
[Shakira]
I left a note on my bedpost
Said not to repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory
The way he makes me feel yeah, gotta hold on me
I've never met someone so different
Oh here we go
He a part of me now, he a part of me
So where you go I follow
[Chorus #1]
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
I can't remember to forget you
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me, the only memory, is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
I can't remember to forget you
Ooooh
I can't remember to forget you
[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed
Repeat yesterday's mistakes
What I'm trying to say is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory
The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel
I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh here we go
He a part of me now he a part of me
[Shakira]
So where he goes I follow, follow, follow, oh
[Chorus 2: Both]
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
I can't remember to forget you
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me, the only memory, is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
I can't remember to forget you
[Bridge: Shakira]
I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I do anything for that boy
[Bridge Cont.: Rihanna]
I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I do anything for that boy
[Chorus 3: Both]
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
I can't remember to forget you
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me, the only memory, is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
I can't remember to forget you
But when you look at me, the only memory, is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohohohoh ohohohoh
I can't remember to forget you
