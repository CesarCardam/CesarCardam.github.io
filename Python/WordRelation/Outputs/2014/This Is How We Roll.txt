49. Florida Georgia Line Featuring Luke BryanHere&#039;s To the Good Times...This Is How We Roll
The mix tape's got a little Hank, little Drake
A little something bumping, thump, thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah you can find us where the party's at
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon baby
This is how we roll
Yeah baby this is how we roll
We rollin' into town
With nothing else to do we take another lap around
Yeah holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me yeah you know we rollin' high
Up on and thirty seven needles, windows tinted hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you but it's for me though
Let's roll!
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we do
When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you baby
This is how we roll
Yeah we're proud to be young
We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun
Yeah we cuss on them Mondays
And pray on them Sundays
Pass is around and we dream about one day
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll
And this is how we ride
We slingin' up the mud, cuttin' through the countryside baby
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll
This is how we do
We're burning down the night shooting bullets at the moon baby
This is how we roll
Yeah this is how we roll
