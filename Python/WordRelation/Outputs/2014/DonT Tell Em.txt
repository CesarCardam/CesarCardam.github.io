42. Jeremih Featuring YGDon&#039;t Tell &#039;Em
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fucking like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you don't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em,
You don't even, you don't even gotta tell 'em,
Don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em
You ain't even, don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't gotta tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em
Know you say you down wit it
Won't tell em how you hit the ground wit it
Girl you know I'm from Chicago, I act a fool, bobby brown wit it (in it)
Nobody take me out tho
You got gifts bring em down the south pole
Marathon girl I put in miles
Don't you worry bout it might gon' work it out

Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That's right, right, right, right, right
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fucking like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you don't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em,
You don't even, you don't even gotta tell 'em,
Don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em
You ain't even, don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't gotta tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em
Girly he foo' fool wit' it
But you know I know what to do wit it
I get it that girl I'm talking laps
As if you got a pool in it
And she say she with your best friends
Then let me be down nin'
You know your feeling like your boy pressed play
Just keep that ass rewindin'
Only is you got me feelin' like this
Ooh why, why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips

Don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em
You ain't even, don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't gotta tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em
Throw it up 9-3-4, 8-6-1-6
I gotta missed call from your bitch
She been plottin' on me for a cool minute
She wanna' suck my dick, and I'm cool with it
I like it in the shower, when it's Winter Fresh
This some twitter pussy I met her on the internet
On my late-night thirsty, 'cause it was late-night and I was thirsty
Girl, I been to that county girl, I ain't tellin'
Handcuff me to the bed, girl there ain't no bailin'
I keep a stack of hundreds like I keep a secret
If anything you were just exploring, you wasn't cheating
She got my number stored under fake names
Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin game
Yolo, so take me out these Polos
And we can fuck from Uno to Ocho
Only is you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why
I'm loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That's right, right, right, right, right
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fucking like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you don't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em,
You don't even, you don't even gotta tell 'em,
Don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em
You ain't even, don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't gotta tell 'em
Don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right,
Don't you tell 'em, don't you tell 'em no
Why, why, why, why, why would do
