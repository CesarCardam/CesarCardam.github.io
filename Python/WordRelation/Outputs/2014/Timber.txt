11. Pitbull Featuring Ke$haGlobal Warming: Meltdown
[Ke$ha]
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget
wooooo oooooh
[Pitbull]
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
This biggity boy's a diggity dog
I have them like Miley Cyrus,
clothes off twerking with my
bras and thongs, timber
Face down, booty up, timber
That's the way we like the war, timber
I'm slicker than an oil spill
She say she won't, but I bet she will, timber
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
[Ke$ha]
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget
It's going down (It's going down)
I'm yelling timber
You better move (You better move)
You better dance (You better dance)
Let's make a night
You won't remember
I'll be the one
You won't forget (You won't forget)
ooooh
[Pitbull]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Nah, it's just me, ain't a damn thing changed
Live in hotels, swing on plane
Blessed to say, money ain't a thing
Club jumping like Lebron, now, Voli
Order me another round, homie
We about to climb, wild, 'cause it's about to go down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
Ooooh
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
[Ke$ha]
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forget (you won't forget)
It's going down (It's going down)
I'm yelling timber
You better move
You better dance (You better dance)
Let's make a night (Let's make a night)
You won't remember
I'll be the one (I'll be the one)
You won't forget (You won't forget)
