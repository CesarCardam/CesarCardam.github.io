13. Deniece WilliamsBlack Butterfly: The Essential Niecy
My baby he don't talk sweet
He ain't got much to say
But he loves me, loves me, loves me
I know that he loves me anyway
And maybe he don't dress fine
But I don't really mind
Because every time he pulls me near
I just want to cheer
Let's hear it for the boy
Let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you go to understand
Whoa, maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my lovin' one-man show
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's hear it for the boy
My baby may not be rich
He's watchin' every dime
But he loves me, loves me, loves
We always have a real good time
And maybe he sings off key
But that's alright by me
Because what he does he does so well
Makes me wanna yell
Let's hear it for the boy
Let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand
Maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my lovin' one man show
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's hear it for the boy
'Cause every time he pulls me near
I just wanna cheer
Let's hear it for the boy
Let's give the boy a hand
Let's hear it for my baby
You know you gotta understand
Maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my lovin' one man show
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's hear it for the boy (Let's hear it for the boy)
Let's hear it for my man (Let's hear it for my baby)
Let's hear it for my baby (Let's hear it for the boy)
(Let's hear it for my baby)
(Let's hear it for the boy)
(Let's hear it for my baby)
(Let's hear it for the boy)
(Let's hear it for my baby)
(Let's hear it for the boy)
(Let's hear it for my babe)
Let's hear it for my man
(Let's hear it for the boy)
(Let's hear it for my babe)
Let's hear it for my man
