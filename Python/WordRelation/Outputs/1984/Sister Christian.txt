40. Night RangerHole in the Sun
Sister Christian
Oh the time has come
And you know that you're the only one
To say O.K.
Where you going
What you looking for
You know those boys
Don't want to play no more with you
It's true
You're motoring
What's your price for flight
In finding mister right
You'll be alright tonight
Babe you know
You're growing up so fast
And mama's worrying
That you won't last
To say let's play
Sister Christian
There's so much in life don't you give it up
Before your time is due
It's true
It's true yeah
What's your price for flight
You've got him in your sight
And driving through the night
Motoring
What's your price for flight
In finding mister right
You'll be alright tonight
What's your price for flight
In finding mister right
You'll be alright tonight
What's your price for flight
In finding mister right
You'll be alright tonight
Oh the time has come
And you know that you're the only one
To say OK.
But you're motoring
You're motoring
