83. Christopher CrossThe Cafe Carlyle Sessions
Every once in a while
I'd see her smile
And she'd turn my day around
A girl with those eyes
Could stare through the lies
And see what your heart was saying
Think of Laura but laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way
When you think of Laura laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way
A friend of a friend
A friend till the end
That's the kind of girl she was
Taken away so young
Taken away without a warning
I know you and you're here
In everyday we live
I know her and she's here
I can feel her when I sing
