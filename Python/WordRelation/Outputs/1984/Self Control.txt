20. Laura Braniganalbum
Oh the night, is my world
City light, painted girl
In the day, nothing matters
It's the night, time that flatters
In the night, no control
Through the wall, something's breaking
Wearing white, as you're walkin'
Down the street, of my soul
You take my self, you take my self control
You got me livin' only for the night
Before the morning comes the story's told
You take my self, you take my self control
Another night, another day goes by
I never stop, myself to wonder why
You help me to, forget to play my role
You take my self, you take my self control
I, I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never comes
A safe night, I'm livin' in the forest of my dream
I know the night is not as it would seem
I must believe in somethin', so I'll make myself believe it
That this night will never go
Oh the night, is my world
City light, painted girl
In the day, nothing matters
It's the night, time that flatters
You take my self, you take my self control
You got me livin' only for the night
Before the morning comes the story's told
You take my self, you take my self control
I, I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never knows
A safe night, I'm livin' in the forest of a dream
I know the night is not as it would seem
I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it
That this night will never go
You take my self, you take my self control
You take my self, you take my self control
You take my self, you take my self control
