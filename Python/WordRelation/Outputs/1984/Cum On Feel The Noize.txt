68. Quiet RiotLive at the Us Festival 1983
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
So you think I got an evil mind
I'll tell you honey
That I don't know why
I don't know why
So you think my singing's out of time
It makes me money
And I don't know why
And I don't know why anymore
Oh no
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We get wild, wild, wild
Let it rock
So you think I got a funny face
I ain't got no worries
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
Oh I gotta sing with some disgrace
I ain't in no hurry
And I don't know why
I don't know why anymore
Oh no
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We get wild, wild, wild
Let it rock
Cum on
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
Let's get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
Let's get wild, wild, wild
Let it rock
(Cum on)
Cum on
Feel it
Cum on
Rock it
We get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
We get wild, wild, wild
Let it rock
Cum on feel the noize
Girls rock your boys
