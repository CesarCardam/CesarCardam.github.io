67. Bruce SpringsteenBorn In The U.S.A.
The times are tough now, just getting tougher
This whole world is rough, it's just getting rougher
Cover me, come on baby, cover me
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
Now promise me baby you won't let them find us
Hold me in your arms, let's let our love blind us
Cover me, shut the door and cover me
I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
Outside's the rain, the driving snow
I can hear the wild wind blowing
Turn out the light, bolt the door
I ain't going out there no more
This whole world is out there just trying to score
I've seen enough I don't wanna see any more,
Cover me, come on in and cover me
I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
Outside's the rain, the driving snow
I can hear the wild wind blowing
Turn out the light, bolt the door
I ain't going out there no more
This whole world is out there just trying to score
I've seen enough I ain't gonna see any more,
Cover me, wrap you arms around and cover me
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
Ah looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
Yeah I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
