62. Rick SpringfieldStripped Down
I can see the path you're cutting
It cost e a little piece of my heart
I can see the doors you're shutting
Cause they were open at the start
Baby loving you has been hard on me
You're such a tough little sister
Just looking for Mr. Right
On the wrong side of town
You better love somebody, it's late
You better love somebody, don't wait
You better love somebody, don't tempt fate
You're gonna push it just a little too far
One night
your eyes are wild, your skin's so white
You're undernourished and overfed
She's got the teeth, she knows how to bite
Cause when you bit I bled
You got some perfect image
Of the perfect man
You're a tough little sister
But you'll settle for a mister tonight
But you're running out of time
You better love somebody, it's late
You better love somebody, don't wait
You better love somebody, don't tempt fate
You're gonna push it just a little too far
One night
I'm only saying what I feel
You think I'm wrong I know
You thought I was sleeping at the wheel
I thought that you were driving
You better love somebody,
You better love somebody,
You better love somebody, it's late
You better love somebody, don't wait
You better love somebody, don't tempt fate
You're gonna push it just a little too far
One night
(repeat chorus)
