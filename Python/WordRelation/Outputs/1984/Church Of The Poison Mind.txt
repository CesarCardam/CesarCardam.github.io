Desolate loving in your eyes
You used and made my life so sweet
Step out like a god found child
I saw your eyes across the street
Who would be the fool to take you
Be more that just kind?
Step into a life of maybe
Love is hard to find in the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
Watch me clinging to the beat
I had to fight to make it mine
That religion you could sink it neat
Just move your feet an' you'll feel fine
Who would be the fool to maybe
Trick a kiss in time?
Who am I to say that's crazy?
Love will make you blind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
Desolate loving in your eyes
You used and made my life so sweet
Step out like a god found child
I saw your eyes across the street
Who would be the fool to take you
Be more that just kind?
Step into a life of maybe
Love is hard to find in the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
In the church of the poison mind
