Ghostbusters
If there's something strange in you neighborhood
Who you gonna call? (ghostbusters)
If there's something weird
And it don't look good
Who you gonna call? (ghostbusters)
I ain't afraid of no ghost
I ain't afraid of no ghost
If you're seeing things running through your head
Who you gonna call? (ghostbusters)
An invisible man
Sleeping in your bed
Who you gonna call? (ghostbusters)
I ain't afraid of no ghost
I ain't afraid of no ghost
Who you gonna call? (ghostbusters)
If you're all alone
Pick up the phone
And call ghostbusters
I ain't afraid of no ghost
I hear it likes the girls
I ain't afraid of no ghost
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Who ya gonna call? (ghostbusters)
If you've had a dose of a freaky ghost baby
You better call, ghostbusters
Lemme tell ya something, bustin' makes me feel good
I ain't afraid of no ghost
I ain't afraid of no ghost
Don't get caught alone no no
Ghostbusters
When it comes through your door
Unless you just want some more
I think you better call (ghostbusters)
Who ya gonna call? (ghostbusters)
Who ya gonna call? (ghostbusters)
I think you better call ghostbusters
Who ya gonna call? (ghostbusters)
I can't hear you
Who ya gonna call? (ghostbusters)
Louder
Ghostbusters
Who ya gonna call? (ghostbusters)
Who can ya call? (ghostbusters)
Who ya gonna call? (ghostbusters)
