73. BananaramaExotica
Hot summer streets
And the pavements are burning
I sit around
Trying to smile but
The air is so heavy and dry
Strange voices are saying
(What did they say)
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort
This heat has got
Right out of hand
It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
The city is crowded
My friends are away
And I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle
So I got to get up and go
It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
Gonna feel only it was
It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me), leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
It's a cruel, cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, cruel summer
Now you're gone
Gonna feel only it was
It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me) leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now you're gone
Gonna feel only it was
It's a cruel, (cruel), cruel summer
(Leaving me), leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel), cruel summer
Now
