46. ScandalThe Warrior
You run, run, runaway it's your
Heart that you betray
Feeding on your hungry eyes
I bet you're not so civilized
Isn't love primitive a wild gift
You wanna give
Break out of captivity
And follow me stereo jungle child
Love is the kill your heart's still wild
[Chorus]
Shootin' at the walls of heartache
Bang, bang, I am the warrior
Yes I am the warrior
And heart to heart you win
If you survive the warrior, the warrior
You talk, talk, talk to me
Your eyes touch me physically
Stay with me, we'll take the night
As passion takes another bite
[Chorus]
Oh, who's the hunter
Who's the game
I feel the beat call your name
I'll hold you close in victory
I don't wanna tame your animal style
You won't be caged
From the call of the wild
[Chorus]
