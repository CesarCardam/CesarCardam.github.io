92. Shalamaralbum
I caught you smiling
I know I've seen you here before
How come you're hiding?
Hey don't you want to hit the floor?
The place is crowded
Or maybe you don't like the beat
I got a two-track playing in my head
So let me take you somewhere else instead
Dancing in the sheets
Dancing in the sheets
Grab your coat and wave goodbye to your friends
I want to take you where the night never ends
I feel the need to sweep you off of your feet
You and me, we should be dancing in the sheets
Dancing in the sheets
We feel the rhythm
We've got the music on our side
If we go with 'em
I'll bet we'll have a wonderful ride
Your hands are cold
So maybe we could make some heat
Love is always born on a chance
So wrap around me and baby let's dance
Dancing in the sheets
Dancing in the sheets
Grab your coat and wave goodbye to your friends
I want to take you where the night never ends
I feel the need to sweep you off of your feet
You and me, we should be dancing in the sheets
Dancing in the sheets
