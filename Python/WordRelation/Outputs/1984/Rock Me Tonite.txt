99. Billy SquierThe Essential Billy Squier
You got me runnin' baby
You give me somethin' way beyond revenue
You put the magic in me
I feel the magic when we do what we do
And oh
I can't do without you for too long you're my situation
You're my kinda lover
My kinda lover
My kinda lover
My kinda lover
My kinda lover
My kinda lover
You keep me all together
You take me out whenever I'm lettin' down
You got the motions baby
I got a notion maybe I'll stick around
And oh
I can never doubt you for too long I can't see no reason
You're my kinda lover
My kinda lover
My kinda lover
My kinda lover
My kinda lover
My kinda lover
When you come 'round I never get down, I fly across the floor
I can see you comin' on me and I can't ask for more
Rock me, sock me, baby you got me ridin' to the end
Rake me, shake me, baby you make me, turn me on again
You got my motor racin'
I find my thoughts embracin' your every move
I want to set you reelin'
I want to make you feel the way that I do
And oh
I been thinkin' 'bout you for so long
I don't want to lose ya, you're my kinda lover
