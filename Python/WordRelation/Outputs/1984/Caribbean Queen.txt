51. Billy Oceanalbum
She dashed by me in painted on jeans
And all heads turned 'cause she was the dream
In the blink of an eye I knew her number and her name yeah
Ah she said I was the tiger she wanted to tame
Caribbean queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run
I lose my cool when she steps in the room
And I get so excited just from her perfume
Electric eyes that you can't ignore
And passion burns you like never before
I was in search of a good time
Just running my game
Love was the furthest
Furthest from my mind
Caribbean queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run
Caribbean queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run
Caribbean queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run
