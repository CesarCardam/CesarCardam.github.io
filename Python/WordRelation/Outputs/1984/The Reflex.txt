16. Duran DuranSeven And The Ragged Tiger
You've gone too far this time
And I'm dancing on the valentine
I tell you somebody's fooling around
With my chances on the danger line
I'll cross that bridge when I find it
Another day
To make my stand, oh oh
High time is no time for deciding
If I should find a helping hand, oh oh
Why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it?
Buy time don't lose it
Why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it?
Buy time don't lose it
The reflex is a lonely child
Who's waiting by the park
The reflex is a door to finding
Treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre
Every little thing the reflex does
Leaves you answered with a question mark
I'm on a ride and I want to get off
But they won't slow down the round-about
I sold the radio and TV set
Don't want to be around when this gets out
So why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it?
Buy time don't lose it
Why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it?
Buy time don't lose it
The reflex is a lonely child
Who's waiting in the park
The reflex is a door to finding
Treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre
Every little thing the reflex does
Leaves you answered with a question mark
So why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it?
Buy time don't loose it
Why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it?
Buy time don't lose it
The reflex is a lonely child
Who's waiting by the park
The reflex is a door to finding
Treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre
Every little thing the reflex does
Leaves you answered with a question mark
Oh the reflex what a game
He's hiding all the cards
The reflex is in charge of finding
Treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre
Every little thing the reflex does
