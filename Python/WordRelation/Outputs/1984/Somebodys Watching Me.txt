26. RockwellSomebody&#039;s Watching Me
Who's watching?
Tell me who's watching.
Who's watching me?
I'm just an average man, with an average life.
I work from nine to five; hey hell, I pay the price.
All I want is to be left alone in my average home;
But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone, and
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
And I have no privacy.
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.
Tell me is it just a dream?
When I come home at night.
I bolt the door real tight.
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid.
Well, can the people on T.V. see me.
Or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower.
I'm afraid to wash my hair.
'Cause I might open my eyes
And find someone standing there.
People say I'm crazy.
Just a little touched.
But maybe showers remind me of
"Psycho" too much.
That's why. . .
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
And I have no privacy.
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.
Who's playing tricks on me?
Who's watching me?
I don't know anymore . . . are the neighbors watching
Who's watching?
Well, it's the mailman watching me: and I don't feel safe anymore.
Tell me who's watching.
Oh, what a mess. I wonder who's watching me now,
(WHO?) the I.R.S.?
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
And I have no privacy.
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.
Who's playing tricks on me?
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
And I have no privacy.
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.
I can't enjoy my tea.
I always feel like somebody's watching me.
I want my privacy.
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.
Stop playing tricks on me
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.
