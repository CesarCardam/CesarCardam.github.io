54. Elton JohnOne Night Only
Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironing out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know
Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on
They reach into your room, oh oh oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
If someone else is suffering enough oh to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues
So turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on
They reach into your room, oh oh oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone
You know sad songs say so much
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say so much
So, turn 'em on, (turn 'em on), turn 'em on, (turn 'em on)
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on
They reach into your room, oh oh oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone
You know sad songs say so much
When all hope is gone
You know sad songs say so much
When ever little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When ever little bit of hope is gone
Sad songs say so much
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say
