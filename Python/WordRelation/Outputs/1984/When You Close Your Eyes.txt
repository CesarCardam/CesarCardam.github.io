What do you do
When it's falling apart
And you know it was going
From the very start
Do you close your eyes
And dream about me
A girl in love
With a gleam in her eye
I was a younger boy
All dressed in white
We're older now
Do you still think about me
I remember we learned about love
In the back of a Chevrolet
Well it felt so good to be young
Feels like yesterday
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me
I guess I don't know what I'm thinking
Coming off a hard night of drinking
Angle come closer to me
I need a soul to bleed on
It could a been done
In a different kinda way
But that ain't you
You play tough when you play
It's over now
I bet you still think about me
I remember I held you so tight
And we danced the night away
With the moves of two wide eyed kids
I need you so much today
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me
I remember we learned about love
In the back of a Chevrolet
No good for an old memory
To mean so much today
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me
When you close your eyes
Do you dream about me
