No more timing each tear that falls from my eyes
I'm not hiding the remedy to cure this old heart of mine
I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
Moving sidewalks, I don't see under my feet
Climbing up from down here below
Where the streets sees me lonely for you.
I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
I can dream about you
I'm gonna press my lips against you and hold you to me
I can dream about you
You know you got me spellbound what else can it be
Moving sidewalks, I don't see under my feet
Climbing up from the pain in my heart 'cause it's you that I need
I can dream!
Oh!
I can dream!
Yes I can dream!
Oh!
I don't understand it
I can't keep my mind off loving you (not even for a minute)
Ooh, now baby, I'm caught up in the magic I see in you
There's one thing to do
I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
Oh!
I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight
I can dream about you
Oh
I can dream
