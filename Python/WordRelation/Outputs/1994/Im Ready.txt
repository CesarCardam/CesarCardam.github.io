Baby it was uncool to love me
Then leave me standing here now
Without a goodbye
And maybe I am the fool you call me
'Cause I'll be here standing,
Waiting to hear you say to me
I'm ready, (you know I'm ready)
To love you (to love you)
Forever (forever)
Hey love now
Come and love me forever more
I'm ready, (you know I'm ready)
To love you (to love you)
Forever (forever)
Hey love now
Come and love me forever more
Sometimes, when I'm alone, I feel sad
I know you'll leave me once again
And take my pride
And maybe I am the fool you call me
'Cause I'll be here standing
Waiting to here you say to me
I'm ready, (you know I'm ready)
To love you (to love you)
Forever (forever)
Hey love now
Come and love me forever more
I'm ready, (you know I'm ready)
To love you (to love you)
Forever (forever)
Hey love now
Come and love me forever more
And once again I'll be right here Waiting to share your love
But I hope this time for once
We'll forever mend it oh
I'm ready, (you know I'm ready)
To love you (to love you)
Forever (forever)
Hey love now
Come and love me forever more
I'm ready, (you know I'm ready)
To love you (to love you)
Forever (forever)
Hey love now
Come and love me forever more
