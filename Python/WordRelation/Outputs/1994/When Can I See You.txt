26. BabyfaceLove Songs
When can my heart beat again
When does the pain ever end
When do the tears stop from running over
When does you'll get over it begin
I hear what you're sayin'
But I swear that it's not making sense
So when can I see you
When can I see you again
When can my heart beat again
When can I see you again
And when can I breathe once again
And when can I see you again
When does my someday begin
When I'll find someone again
And what if I still am not truly over
What am I supposed to do then
Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if, if it's not making sense
So when can I see you
[HOOK]
Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if, if it's not making sense
So when can I see you
[HOOK 2 times]
