36. Tevin Campbellalbum
Last night I,
I saw you standing,
And I started,
Started pretending,
I knew you and you knew me too,
And just like a roni,
You were too shy,
But you weren't the only,
Cause so was I,
And I've dreamed of you ever since,
Now I've built up my confidence,
Girl next,
Next time you come my way,
I'll know just what to say
Can we talk for a minute
Girl I want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute
Girl I want to know your name
I started
To write you a letter
But I wanted
To be more clever
I wanted to get down and sweet talk you
Hey, baby
But just like a roni you were too shy
But you weren't the only one, so was I
Girl if
We should come close again
I know what I'll say then
Oh, girl
One more chance
With you again
I will not let it go
Ooh, babe
Give me just one more chance
For love, love, love, love
