38. Meat LoafBat Out Of Hell II: Back Into Hell
And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'd never lie to you and that's a fact
But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
Oh no, no way
And I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that
Some days it don't come easy
Some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all, and these are the days that never end
Some nights you're breathing fire
Some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before or will again
Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me, no-one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long dreams are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do
Anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, I won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do that
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of, but I just won't do
Some days I pray for silence
Some days I pray for soul
Some days I just pray to the god of sex and drums and rock 'n' roll
Maybe I'm lonely, that's all I'm qualified to be
That's just one and only, the one and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You'd better believe it, that I would do
Anything for love
And you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love, and there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you, so long, so long
I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love, but I won't do that
No, no, no, I won't do that
Will you raise me up? will you help me down?
Will you get me right out of this godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?
I can do that
I can do that
Will you cater to every fantasy I got?
Will you hose me down with holy water, if I get too hot?
Will you take me places I've never known?
I can do that
Oh no, I can do that
I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwing around
I won't do that
No, I won't do that
Anything for love
But I won't do that
