If I never feel you in my arms again,
If I never feel your tender kiss again,
If I never hear "I love you" now and then,
Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand, if love ends,
Then I promise you, I promise you that,
That I shall never breathe again.
Breathe again, breathe again,
That I shall never breathe again.
And I can't stop thinking about,
About the way things used to be,
And I can't stop thinking about,
About the love that you made to me.
And I can't get you out of my head;
How in the world will I begin
To let you walk right out of my life
And throw my heart away?
And I can't stop caring about,
About the apple of my eye,
And I can't stop doing without,
Without the center of my life.
And I can't get you out of my head,
And I know I can't pretend
That I won't die if you decide
You won't see me again.
If I never feel you in my arms again,
If I never feel your tender kiss again,
If I never hear "I love you" now and then,
Will I never make love to you once again?
Please understand, if love ends,
Then I promise you, I promise you that,
That I shall never breathe again.
Breathe again, breathe again,
That I shall never breathe again.
And I can't stop thinking about,
About the way my life would be.
No, I can't stop thinking about,
How could you love me then leave?
And I can't get you out of my mind,
God knows how hard I've tried,
And if you walk right out my life,
God knows I'm sure to die.
And I can't stop doing without,
Without the rhythm of my heart.
No, I can't stop doing without,
For I will surely fall apart.
And I can't get you out of my mind,
And I know I can't deny,
And I would die if you decide
You won't see me again.
