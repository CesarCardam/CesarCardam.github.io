Let me see you go back
Let me see you come forth
Now let me see you go back
Let me see you come forth
Let me see you go back
Let me see you come forth
Let me see you go back
Let me see you come forth
It's Friday and I'm ready to swing
Pick up my girls and hit the party scene
Tonight, oh it's alright
So get up and let this funky mellow groove
Get you in the mood
Cause you know it's alright
So Mr.DJ keep the music groovin' (keep on groovin')
Don't stop movin' (don't stop movin')
Let me see you, let me see you go
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Now's the time for you to make your move
To the dance floor
So throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em round like you just don't care
Who it's the L-I-why-A-H, rippin' up the stage
I got jazz personality, G mentality, beats to soul train
So Mr.DJ keep the music groovin'
Don't stop movin'
Now let me see you back and forth, back and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Hey, here's the formality, get up on the floor you see
Show your personality, be who you want to be
Tell me
So can you feel the groove movin' way down to you
Hey, I want to keep this party goin' on all night
So Mr.DJ keep the music groovin (keep on groovin')
Don't stop movin' (don't stop movin')
Now let me see you go back and forth, back and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Back, back, forth and forth
Who it's the L-I-Y-A-H?
