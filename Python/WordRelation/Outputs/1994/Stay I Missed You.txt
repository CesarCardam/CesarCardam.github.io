You say
I only hear what I want to
And you say
I talk so all the time, so
And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong
'Cause I missed you
Yeah I missed you
And you say
I only hear what I want to
I don't listen hard
I don't pay attention
To the distance
That you're running or to
Anyone anywhere
I don't understand if you really care
I'm only hearing negative, no no no, bad
So I, I turned the radio on,
Iturned the radio up
And this woman was singing my song
Lovers in love and the other's run away
Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay
And some of us hover when we weep
For the other who was dying
Since the day they were born, well
Well, this is not that
I think that I'm throwing
But I'm thrown
And I thought I'd live forever
But now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
But that won't take me anyhow
Or anywhere,
With you
And you said that I was naive
And I thought that I was strong
I thought, "hey, I can leave, I can leave"
Oh but now I know that I was wrong
'Cause I missed you
Yeah, I missed you
You said, "you caught me cause you want me
And one day I'll let you go"
You try to give away a keeper
Or keep me 'cause you know you're just so
Scared to lose
And you say,
"Stay"
You say
I only hear what I want to
