23. Jon SecadaHeart, Soul, And A Voice
Taking a day at a time
Dealing with feelings I don't want to hide
Learning to love as I go, baby
Without taking you along for a ride, I
Tried to find myself
Tried to find the truth
Get out from this shell
Girl I'm almost there
To show you how much I really care
If you go say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know
That all I really want is you (you)
Sorry if you felt misled
But I know what I feel
I know what I said, baby
God I hope you believe
Believe in all that we can be
The future in us together in love
You're the reason I'm strong
Don't you think I don't know
This is where I belong
Give me the time
To say that you're mine
To say that you're mine
If you go say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know
That all I really want is you
All I really want is you
If you go say goodbye (say goodbye)
There'll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know ('cause you know)
That all I really want is you
Tried to find myself (tried to find myself)
Tried to find the truth
Get out from this shell
Girl I'm almost there
So let me show you, so let me show you
If you go say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life (in my life)
'Cause you know (baby)
That all I really want is you (you)
(Baby) if you go say goodbye (say goodbye)
There'll be something missing in my life
'Cause you know (baby)
That all I really want is you (all I really)
(All I really want, all I really want is you)
If you go say goodbye
There'll be something missing in my life (in my life)
'Cause you know
That all I really want is you
