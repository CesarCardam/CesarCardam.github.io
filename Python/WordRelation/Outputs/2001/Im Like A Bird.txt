43. Nelly FurtadoWhoa Nelly!
You're beautiful and that's for sure
You'll never ever fade
Your lovely, but it's not for sure
And I won't ever change
And though my love is rare
And though my love is true
I'm like a bird
I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird
I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And I need for you to know
Is your faith in me brings me to tears
Even after all these years
And it pains me so much to tell
That you don't know me that well
And though my love is rare
And though my love is true
I'm like a bird
I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird
I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
It's not that I want to say good-bye
It's just that every time you try to
Tell me, me that you love me (Oh, oh)
Each and every single day
I know I'm gonna have to eventually give you away, yeah
And though my love is rare
And though my love is true yeah
And I'm just scared
That we may fall through, yeah, yeah
I'm like a bird (I'm like a bird)
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird
I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird
I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is (Soul is)
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird
I'll only fly away (I don't know where my soul is)
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird
I'll only fly away (I don't know where my soul is)
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
I'm like a bird
I'll only fly away
I don't know where my soul is
I don't know where my home is
And baby all I need for you to know is
