40. MyaFear Of Flying
It's after midnight and she's on your phone (phone)
Saying come over cause she's all alone (lone)
I could tell it was your ex by your tone (tone)
Why is she calling now after so long?
Now what is it that she wants?
Tell me what is it that she needs?
Did she hear about the brand new Benz that you just bought for me?
'Cause y'all didn't have no kids,
Didn't share no mutual friends,
And you told me that she turned trick
When y'all broke up in '96
What you goin' do when you can't say no?
When the feelings start to show
Boy I really need to know, and
How you gonna act? How you gonna handle that?
What you goin' do when she wants you back?
What you goin' do when you can't say no?
When the feelings start to show
Boy I really need to know, and
How you gonna act? How you gonna handle that?
What you goin' do when she wants you back?
There's no need to reminisce 'bout the past (past)
Obviously 'cause that shit did not last (last)
I know how a woman will try to game you (you)
Don't get caught up because baby you'll lose
Now what is it that she wants?
Tell me what is it that she needs?
Did she hear about the brand new Benz that you just bought for me?
'Cause y'all didn't have no kids,
Didn't share no mutual friends,
And you told me that she turned trick
When y'all broke up in '96
What you goin' do when you can't say no?
When the feelings start to show
Boy I really need to know, and
How you gonna act? How you gonna handle that?
What you goin' do when she wants you back?
What you goin' do when you can't say no?

What you goin' do when you can't say no?
When the feelings start to show
Boy I really need to know, and
How you gonna act? How you gonna handle that?
What you goin' do when she wants you back?
Tell me, why she on the phone in the middle of the night?
Tell me, why she in yo life tryna get what's mine?
She don't know me, she's about to know me
I'm in your life, and that's how it's goin' be
I saw a photo, she ain't even all that
So if you want her back, then take her back
'Cause game recognize game,
I can do the same thing
Get a right change
Or take back this ring!
What you goin' do when you can't say no?
When the feelings start to show
Boy I really need to know, and
How you gonna act? How you gonna handle that?
What you goin' do when she wants you back?
