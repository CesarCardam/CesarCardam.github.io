60. ToyaToya
He was a six foot stallion say a story of a thug
He was the kind that made you wonder how he put down the love
He had a hickey in his pocket a phat rock in his ear
He made my heart stop pulputatin every time he came near
He had a spankin new Range for that tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin he was plaided, and his head was cornrowed
He had his wrists bling blinging and his long legs was bow
He tried to push up on me but I knew he had me at go
I Do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
Wit an iced out playah ballin out of control
I Do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
Wit an iced out playah ballin out of control
Me and my crew started groovin
Made our way to the floor
Its time to activate my plan and give this hottie a show
I shook my hips, took a dip, roll my tongue 'cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance wit me I felt fingertips
On the small of my back, so I had to react
Like I was playin hard to get and told that boy to step back
But when I looked deep in his eyes all I could see was his soul
I'm bout to make this guy my man that I can tell you, fa 'sho
I Do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
Wit an iced out playah ballin out of control
I Do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
Wit an iced out playah ballin out of control
Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellahs who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips as I dip and roll
Watch me stop, stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowin all the papi's want me but all I want is you
(I do)
Watch me drop, drop, shake it for the fellahs who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips as I dip and roll
Watch me stop, stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowin' all the papi's want me but all I want is you
I Do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
Wit an iced out playah ballin' out of control
I Do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
Wit an iced out playah ballin' out of control
I Do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
Wit an iced out playah ballin' out of control
I Do, I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes, I entice you
So come on shorty if you think you can roll
Wit an iced out playah ballin' out of control
