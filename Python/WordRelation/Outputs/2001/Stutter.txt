13. Joe Featuring MystikalMy Name Is Joe
Baby don't go
Baby don't go
Baby don't go
I need you
Talk to me tell me
Where you were late last night?
You told me with your friends
Hangin' out late last night
You're lyin' cause you're stuttering
Now where were you late last night?
Stop lying to me cause you're ticking me off
See you're ticking me off, ooh girl
[Chorus: x4]
I can tell you're lying
Cause when you're lying
You stutter, stutter, stutter, stutter
Listen,
I called you on your cell phone
No answer, tell me why
So I paged you on your two way
Still no response, tell me why
I took care of you, I love you
And you played me, tell me why
Stop lying to me about where you've been
Cause you're ticking me off, tick-tick-ticking me off
[Chorus: x4]
Now it's funny to me
When you lie to me
You starting stuttering
Tripping, I caught you baby
It's funny to me
When you lie to me
You starting stuttering
Tripping, I caught you baby
I smell cologne damn it's strong
How did ya get it on?
I'm not dumb
He messed up your hair
Make-up's every where
Ooh yeah I'm not dumb
Girl I'm dying 'cause your lyin'
To my face, I'm not dumb
Stop lying to me about seeing a man
Cause you're ticking me off, oh
[Chorus: x6]
Oh no baby no more from you
I hear you lying, I hear you stuttering
Stu-stuttering, stuttering
Stu-stuttering, stuttering
Oh girl, you should leave me alone
Get the hell on
