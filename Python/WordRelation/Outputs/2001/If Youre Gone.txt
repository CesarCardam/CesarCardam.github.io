I think I've already lost you
I think you're already gone
I think I'm finally scared now
You think I'm weak, I think you're wrong
I think you're already leaving
Feels like your hand is on the door
I thought this place was an empire
Now I'm relaxed, I can't be sure
And I think you're so mean
I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life and
I think I'm scared
I think too much
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealing
If you're gone, maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
If you're gone, baby you need to come home, come home
There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you
I bet you're hard to get over
I bet the room just won't shine
I bet my hands I can stay here
And I bet you need more than you mind
And I think you're so mean
I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life
I think I'm just scared that I know too much
I can't relate and that's a problem I'm feeling
If you're gone, maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
If you're gone, baby you need to come home, come home
There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you
I think you're so mean
I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life and
I think I'm scared
Do I talk too much?
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealing
If you're gone, maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
If you're gone
Hell baby, you need to come home, come home
There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you (you)
(Something in me)
(Everything in you)
(Something in me)
In you
