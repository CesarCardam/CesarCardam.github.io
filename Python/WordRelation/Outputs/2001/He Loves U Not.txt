28. DreamIt Was All A Dream
Give it your all girl, give it all ya got.
Take your chance at a second hand shot.
Say what you want girl, Do what you do.
He's never gonna, gonna make it with you.
Pulling petals off a flower trying to get your way.
Keep pulling til'it says what you want to say.
Girl you can pick a field full of Daises but he'd still be my baby
I know you can hardly wait till I'm away from him
Instinctively, I know what you're thinking,
You'll be giving him an open invitation,
But my baby won't be taken it.
You can pout your cherry lips,
Try to tempt with a sweet kiss.
You can flutt your pretty eyes,
He ain't got his hands tied.
No chains to unlock,
So free to do what he wants
he's into what he's got
He loves me, he loves you not
No matter what you do, he's never gonna be with you,
he's into what he's got,
He loves me, he loves you not
You're the kind of girl that is always up for do or dare.
Only want him just because he's there.
Always looking for a new ride,
The grass is greener on the other side.
You're the kind of girl who's not use to hearing no,
All your lovers try to take you where you want to go.
It doesn't matter how hard you try, you're never gonna get with my guy.
No chains to unlock,
So free to do what he wants
he's into what he's got (and that's me)
He loves me, he loves you not
No matter what you do, he's never gonna be with you,
he's into what he's got,
He loves me, he loves you not
Doesn't matter what you do, he's never gonna be with you.
Give it your all girl, give it all ya got.
You can take your chance at a second hand shot.
Say what you want girl, do what you do.
He's never gonna make it with you.
You can pout your cherry lips ( yeah )
Try to tempt him with a sweet kiss ( sweet kiss )
You can flutt your pretty eyes ( pretty eyes )
He ain't got his hands tied.
No chains to unlock,
So free to do what he wants.
He's into what he's got,
He loves me, he loves you not.
No matter what you do, he's never gonna be with you.
He is into what he's got,
He loves me, He loves you not....
No chains to unlock,
So free to do what he wants.
He's into what he's got, (and that's me)
He loves me, he loves you not.
No matter what you do, he's never gonna be with you.
He is into what he's got, (and that's me)
He loves me, He loves you not....
