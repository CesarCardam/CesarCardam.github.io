62. TamiaA Nu Day
Mm, mm oh
I don't understand
You look just like the man
In the picture by our bed
The suspense is pounding and clouding up my head
I'm checking your clothes
And you wear the same size shoe
You sleep in his spot and your driving his car
But I don't know just who you are
There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you can say who you say you are
You got to be someone else
Because he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do (you do)
He would adore he, he wouldn't ignore me
So I am convinced that there's a stranger in my house
Now show who you are
Don't see your shadow around when you walk
Your leaving no kisses
Goodbye with no words
If these walls could talk
They would have nothing to tell
So what could it be
Is there someone imitating me
Could she be taking my place
Look me in the face
And tell me that I am wrong when I say
There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There is no way you can say who you say you are
You got to be someone else
Because he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do (you do)
He would adore he, he wouldn't ignore me
So I am convinced that there's a
Stranger in my house
Pop quiz
Tell me where we first kissed
Tell me where my spot is
Tell me if I like it, love it
Or could it be
That the stranger is me
Have I changed so drastically
Is it I want more then me
And you remain the same
There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
It took a while to figure out
You can't be who you say you are
You got to be someone else
Because he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore he, he wouldn't ignore me
So I am convinced that there's a stranger in my house
Woo
There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
It took a while to figure out
You can't be who you say you are
You got to be someone else
Because he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore he, he wouldn't ignore me
So I am convinced that there's a stranger in my house
