22. City HighCity High
Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowin' the cup
About 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonnie, she went to Junior High with me
I said, "Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lots changed since I seen you last"
She said
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lock down
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life
Girl, you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said, "Everyday I wake up hopin' to die"
She said, "Nigga, I know about pain
'cause me and my sister ran away
So my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I done been through more shit
You can't even relate to!"
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lock down
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life
Hold up!
Then she said, what would you do?
Get up on my feet and let go off every excuse
What would you do?
'Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through
C'mon, what would you do?
Get up on my feet, stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Girl, I know if my mother can do it, baby, you can do it
Oooo, oooo, oooo
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lock down
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone somewhere smoking rock now
In and out of lock down
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life
Come on
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone
On the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money?
And his daddy's gone somewhere smokin' rock now
In and out of lock down
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life
