Yeah unh
Get up ow!
Ow!
Knock me out, dead
Woo!
Superhighways, coast to coast, easy to get anywhere
On the transcontinental overload, just slide behind the wheel
How does it feel when there's no destination that's too far?
And somewhere on the way you might find out who you are, ooo
Living in America
Eye to eye, station to station
Living in America
Hand in hand, across the nation
Living in America
I got to have a celebration, rock my soul, huh, aw, huh
Smokestack, fatback, many miles of railroad track
All night radio keep on runnin' through your rock 'n' roll soul
All night diners keep you awake on black coffee and a hard roll, woo
You might have to walk a fine line, say it, you might take a hard line
But everybody's workin' overtime
Living in America, unh
Eye to eye, station to station
Living in America
Hand in hand, across the nation
Living in America
I got to have a celebration, oh
I live in America
Said, I live in America
Wait a minute
You may not be lookin' for the promised land
But you might find it anyway
Under one of those old familiar names like
New Orleans, Detroit City, Dallas
Pittsburgh P.A, New York City
Kansas City, Atlanta, Chicago and L. A.
Living in America
Hit me
Living in America, yeah
Living in America
I live in America
Not yet
I live in America, hey I know what it means, I
Living in America
Eddie Murphy eat your heart out
To the bridge, eh
Living in America
Hit me, I said now, eye to eye, station to station
Living in America
Oh, so nice with your bad self
Living in America
Whoah, I feel good
