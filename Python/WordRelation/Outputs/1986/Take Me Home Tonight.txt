59. Eddie Moneyalbum
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, eeh, yeah, eeh, yeah
I feel a hunger, it's a hunger
That tries to keep a man awake at night
Are you the answer I shouldn't wonder
When I feel you whet my appetite
With all the power you're releasing
It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone
Anticipation's running through me
Let's find the key and turn this engine on
I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey
Just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Oh, oh, oh
I get frightened in all this darkness
I get nightmares I hate to sleep alone
I need some company a guardian angel
To keep me warm when the cold winds blow
I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey
Just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Be my little baby
Just like Ronnie sang
I said, just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Baby my darling, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I feel your hunger
It's a hunger
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey
Just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey
Just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey
Just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey
Just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
