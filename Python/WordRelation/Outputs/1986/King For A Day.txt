I know you well
And I can tell
Something's on your mind
'cause in your dreams
The demon screams
And I know he's going to hurt you blind
(bridge)
You say you hunger for something you can't get at all
And love is not enough anymore
(chorus)
IF I WAS KING FOR JUST ONE DAY
I WOULD GIVE IT ALL AWAY
I WOULD GIVE IT ALL AWAY TO BE WITH YOU
IF I WAS KING FOR JUST ONE DAY
I HAD JUST ONE THING TO SAY
YOU KNOW THAT LOVE IS
ALL WE NEED TO GET US THROUGH
Diamond rings
And all those things
They never sparkle like your smile
And as for fame
It's just a name
That only satisfies you for a while
(REPEAT BRIDGE & CHORUS)
I've heard it said
Or maybe read
Only money makes the world go 'round
But all the gold
Won't heal your soul
If your world should tumble to the ground
(REPEAT BRIDGE)
So listen,
Love is all, love is all, love is all we need
Love is all, love is all, love is all we need yeah.
Love is all, love is all, love is all we need
Love is all, love is all, love is all we need yeah.
(REPEAT CHORUS TWICE)
If I was King
For just one day
For just one thing to say
Love...
