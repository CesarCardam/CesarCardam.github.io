You take my breath away oh
Love thinks it's here to stay oh
There's still so much for me to do
And I can't stop loving you
Oh, can this be true?
If you could see what I have seen oh
(The) broken hearts and broken dreams oh
Then I wake up, and you're not there
Pain finds me everywhere
Oh, but you don't care
Don't forget me when I'm gone
My heart would break
I have loved you for so long
It's all I can take
You, you take my breath away oh
Love thinks it's here to stay oh
There's still so much for me to do
And I can't stop loving you
Oh, can this be true?
Don't forget me when I'm gone
My heart would break
I have loved you for so long
It's all I can take
Then I wake up, and you're not there
Pain finds me everywhere
Oh, but you don't care
Don't forget me when I'm gone
For heaven's sake
I have loved you for so long
It's nothin' wrong
So don't forget me when I'm gone
My heart would break
I have loved you for so long
It's nothin' wrong
