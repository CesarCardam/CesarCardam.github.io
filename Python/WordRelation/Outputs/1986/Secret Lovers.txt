12. Atlantic Starralbum
Here we are the two of us together
Taking this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if they found out
It could mess up, both our happy homes
I hate to think about us all meeting up together
As soon as I looked at you it would show on my face
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
They can never no, oh no, we can't leave a trace
Secret Lovers that's what we are, we shouldn't be together
But we can't let it go, oh no, cause we love each other so
Sittin at home I do nothing all day
But think about you and hope that your ok
Hoping you'll call before anyone gets home
I'll wait anxiously, alone by the phone
How could something so wrong be so right
I wish we didn't have to keep our love out of sight
Living two lives just ain't easy at all
But we gotta hang on and after fall
Secret lovers that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go, cause what we feel is oh so real
So real
You and me, are we fair
Is this cruel, or do we care
Can they tell what's in our minds
Maybe they've had secret love all of the time
In the middle of makin love we notice the time
We both get nervous cause it's way after nine
Even though we hate it, we know it's time that we go
We gotta be careful, so that no one will know
Secret lovers, that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go
'Cause what we feel is oh so real
So real
