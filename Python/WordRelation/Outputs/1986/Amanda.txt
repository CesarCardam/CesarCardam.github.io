Babe, tomorrow's so far away
There's something I just have to say
I don't think I can hide what I'm feelin' inside
Another day, knowin' I love you
And I, I'm getting too close again
I don't want to see it end
If I tell you tonight will you turn out the light
And walk away knowin' I love you?
I'm gonna take you by surprise
And make you realize,
Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away,
I can't wait another day,
Amanda
I'm gonna say it like a man
And make you understand
Amanda
I love you
And I feel like today's the day
I'm lookin' for the words to say
Do you want to be free, are you ready for me
To feel this way
I don't want to lose you
So, it may be too soon, I know
The feeling takes so long to grow
If I tell you today will you turn me away
And let me go?
I don't want to lose you
I'm gonna take you by surprise
And make you realize,
Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away,
I can't wait another day,
Amanda
I'm gonna say it like a man
And make you understand
Amanda
You and I
I know that we can't wait
And I swear, I swear it's not a lie girl
Tomorrow may be too late
You, you and I girl
We can share a life together
It's now or never
And tomorrow may be too late
And, feelin' the way I do
I don't want to wait my whole life through
To say I'm in love with you
