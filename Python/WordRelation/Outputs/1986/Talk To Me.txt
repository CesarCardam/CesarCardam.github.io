57. Stevie NicksHouse of Blues: The Classic 1994 Broadcast
I can see we're thinkin' bout the same things
And I can see your expression when the phone rings
We both know there's something happening here
Well,there's no sense in dancing round the subject
A wound gets worse when it's treated with neglect
Don't turn around ,there's nothing here to fear
[Chorus]
You can talk to me
Talk to me
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free,baby
Dusty words lying under carpets
Seldom heard well must you keep your secrets
Locked inside hidden safe from view
Well,is it all that hard
Is it all that tough
Well,I've shown you all my cards now isn't that enough
You can hide your hurt
But,there's something you can do
You can talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
I can set your secrets free,baby
La, la, la, la
Though we lay face to face and cheek to cheek
Our voices stray from the common ground where they could meet
The walls run high, to veil a swelling tear
Oh,let the walls burn down,set your secrets free
You can break their bounds, cause you're safe with me
You can lose your doubt,cause you'll find no danger not here
[Chorus]
Oh,I can see you running, I can see you running
I can see you running all the way back home
I can see your expression when the phone rings
And I can see your thinkin' bout the same things
Is it all that hard
Is it all that tough
Well, you've taken all there is now baby
Isn't that enough
Well, I can see you runnin', i can see you runnin'
All the way back
