47. Miami Sound Machinealbum
I realize you're seeing someone new
But I don't believe she knows you like I do
Your temperamental moody side
The one you always try to hide from me
But I know when you've got something on your mind
You've been trying to tell me for the longest time
But before you break my heart in two
There's something I've been trying to say to you
But the words get in the way
There's so much I want to say
But it's locked deep inside and if you look in my eyes
We might fall in love again
I won't even start to cry
Before we say goodbye
I'm trying to say I love you but the words get in the way
Your heart has always been an open book
But baby I don't even know you anymore
And despite the fact it's hurting me
I know the time has come to set you free
