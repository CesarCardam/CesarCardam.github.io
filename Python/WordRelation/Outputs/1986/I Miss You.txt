03. KlymaxxMeeting in the Ladies Room
I thought I heard your voice yesterday
When I turned around to say
That I loved you then I realized
And it was just my mind
Playing tricks on me
It seems colder lately at night
And I try to sleep with the lights on
Every time the phone rings
I pray to God it's you
I just can't believe
That we're through
I miss you (I miss you)
There's no other way to say it
And I, and I can deny it
I miss you (I miss you)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me
Is it done and over this time?
Have we really changed our minds
But it's all this love
All the feelings that we used to share
I refused to believe
That you don't care
I miss you (I miss you)
There's no other way to say it
And I, and I can deny it
I miss you (I miss you)
It's so easy to see
I've got to gather my senses together
I've been through worse kinds of weather
If it's over now, be strong
I can't believe that you're gone
I've got carry on
I miss you (I miss you)
Oh no other way to say it
And I, and I can deny it
I miss you (I miss you)
It's so easy to see
That you're part of me now
No other way to say it
It's so easy to see
That you're part of me now
It's driving me crazy
It's so easy to see
That you're part of me now
That you're part of me now
I miss you (I miss you)
It's driving me crazy
I don't want to live without you
I miss you (I miss you)
It's so easy to see
I'm missing me
