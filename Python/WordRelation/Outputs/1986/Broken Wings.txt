05. Mr. Misteralbum
Baby I don't understand
Why we can't just hold on
To each others hands
This time will be the last
I fear unless I make it all so clear
I need you so
Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
And learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up
And let us in
Baby I think tonight
We can take what was wrong
And make it right
I need you so
Baby it's all I know
That you're half of the flesh
And blood makes me whole
I need you so
