40. Miami Sound Machinealbum
Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it 'til you tried it, do that conga beat
Everybody gather 'round now
Let your body feel the heat
Don't you worry if you can't dance;
Let the music move your feet
It's the rhythm of the island, and like the sugar cane so sweet
If you want to do the conga, you've got to listen to the beat
Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it 'til you tried it, do that conga beat
Feel the fire of desire, as you dance the night away
Cause tonight were gonna party, 'til we see the break of day
Better get yourself together, and hold on to what you've got
Once the music hits your system, there's no way your gonna stop
Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it 'til you tried it, do that conga beat
Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it 'til you tried it, do that conga beat
Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it 'til you tried it, do that conga beat
Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
