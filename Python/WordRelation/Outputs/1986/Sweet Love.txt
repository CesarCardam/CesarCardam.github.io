90. Anita BakerA Night of Rapture
With all my heart, I love you baby
Stay with me, and you will see my arms will hold you, baby
Never leave, 'cause I believe I'm in love
Sweet love hear me callin' out your name
I feel no shame; I'm in love
Sweet love, don't you ever go away
It'll always be this way
Your heart has called me closer to you
I will be all that you need
Just trust in what we're feeling
Never leave, 'cause baby, I believe
In this love
Sweet love hear me callin' out your name
I feel no shame; I'm in love
Sweet love, don't you ever go away
It'll always be this way
There's no stronger love in this world, Oh, baby, no
You're my man; I'm your girl
I'll never go. Wait and see, can't be wrong
Don't you know this is where you belong?
How sweet this dream, how lovely, baby
Stay right here, never fear
I will be all that you need
Never leave, 'cause baby, I believe
In this love
Sweet love hear me callin' out your name
I feel no shame; I'm in love
Sweet love, don't you ever go away
It'll always be this way
