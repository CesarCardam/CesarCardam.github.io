Go now, don't look back, we've drawn the line
Move on, it's no good to go back in time
I'll never find another girl like you, for happy endings it takes two
We're fire and ice, the dream won't come true
Sara, Sara, storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara, no time is a good time for goodbyes
Danger in the game when the stakes are high
Branded, my heart was branded while my senses stood by
I'll never find another girl like you, for happy endings it takes two
We're fire and ice, the dream won't come true
Sara, Sara, storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara, no time is a good time, oh
Sara, Sara, storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara, no time is a good time for goodbyes
('Cause Sara) Loved me like no one has ever loved me before
(And Sara) Hurt me, no one could ever hurt me more
(And Sara) Sara, nobody loved me anymore
I'll never find another girl like you, no
We're fire and ice, and a dream
Sara
Sara, Sara no time is a good time, oh
Sara, Sara, storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara, no time is a good time, for good bye's
Sara, Sara, storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara no time like the first time
Sara, Sara
Ooh Sara, why did it, why did it, why did it all fall apart
Sara, Sara (uh Sara)
Sara
