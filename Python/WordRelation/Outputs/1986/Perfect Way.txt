64. Scritti Polittialbum
I took a backseat a backhander I took her back to her room
I better get back to the basics for you
You gotta conscience compassion you got away with the word
You gotta heart full of complacency too
I don't have a purpose omission I'm empty by definition
I got a lack girl that you'd love to be
You want to diva a deduction you want to do what they do
want to do damage that you can undo
Apart from everyone away from your love
A part of me belongs apart from all the hurt above
[Chorus]
I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification
I got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
I got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy
I took a day job amendment I took a liking to you
I took a page out of my rulebook for you
You want to message a confession you want to martyr me too
You want to margin of error for two
Maybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better
I've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue
I made an offer an exception I made a sense out of you
You took a good look at your book but I knew
In times of tenderness in terms baby so true
Until such time as I can understand all the things you do
Want to forgive you for all the things that you do
want to forget how to remember with you
Maybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better
I've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue
[Chorus]
