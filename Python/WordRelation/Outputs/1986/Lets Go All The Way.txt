45. Sly FoxLet&#039;s Go All The Way
Sitting with the thinker, trying to work it out
It's a traffic jam of the brain, makes you want to scream and shout
Presidential party, no one wants to dance
Looking for a new star to put you in a trance
Let's go all the way
Let's go all the way
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, let's go all the way
Working in a factory eight days a week
Try to make dollar, damn what a beat
Cartoon capers happen in reality
Rich man, poor man, living in fantasy
Let's go all the way
Let's go all the way
Oh oh oh, let's go all the way
Wow, thinker
Yeah yeah yeah
Living in New York, looks like an apple core (apple core)
Asphalt jungle, got to be a man of war
California dreamers sinking in the sand (the sand, the sand, the sand)
The Hollywood squares are living in Disneyland
Wee! Ho
Let's go all the way (let's go all the way)
Let's go all the way (let's go)
Ah, we can make a better way
Let's go all the way
Go all the way
Let's go all the way
Yeah
Na na na-na na na na na na na na-na
Na na na-na na yeah
