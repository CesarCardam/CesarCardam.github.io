69. Van HalenLive: Right Here, Right Now
Oh here it comes
That funny feeling again winding me up inside
Every time we touch
Hey I don't know
Oh, tell me where to begin cause I never ever
Felt so much
And I can't recall any love at all
Baby this blows 'em all away
It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
Straight from my heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love?
I tell myself
Hey only fools rush in and only time will tell
If we stand the test of time
All I know
You've got to run to win and I'll be damned if
I'll get hung up on the line
Hey
No I can't recall anything at all
Oh baby this blows them all away
Woo
It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
You want it straight from the heart
Oh tell me why can't this be love?
It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
Straight from my heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love?
Baby why can't this be love
Got to know why can't this be love
I wanna know why can't this be love
