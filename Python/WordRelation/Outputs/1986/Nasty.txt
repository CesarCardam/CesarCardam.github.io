58. Janet JacksonDesign Of A Decade 1986/1996
Gimme a beat!
Sittin' in the movie show, thinkin' nasty thoughts, huh
Better be a gentleman, or you turn me off, huh
That's right,
a-let me tell it
Nasty Nasty boys, don't mean a thing, huh
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty Nasty boys, don't ever change, huh
Oh you nasty boys!
I don't like no nasty car, I don't like a nasty food, huh (Oh oh yeah)
The only nasty thing I like is the nasty groove, huh
Will this one do?
Uhuh, I know Sing
