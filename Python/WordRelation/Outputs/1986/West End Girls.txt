15. Pet Shop BoysDisco
Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West end town
Call the police there's a mad man around
Running down underground
To a dive bar in a West end town
In a West end town a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls
In a West end town in a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls
West end girls.
Too many shadows whispering voices
Faces on posters too many choices
If when why what how much have you got
Have you got it do you get it
If so how often
Which do you choose
A hard or soft option
(How much do you need)
In a West end town a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls
In a West end town in a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls
West end girls.
(How much do you need)
In a West end town a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls
Ooh a West end town in a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls
West end girls.
You got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait till I get you home
We've got no future
We've got no past
Here today built to last
In every city and every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station
(How far have you been)
In a West end town a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls
In a West end town in a dead end world
The East end boys and West end girls
West end girls.
West end girls
West end girls
