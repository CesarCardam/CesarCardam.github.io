75. Michael McDonaldalbum
No more runnin' down the wrong road
Dancin' to a different drum
Can't you see what's goin' on
Deep inside your heart
Always searchin' for the real thing
Livin' like it's far away
Just leave all the madness in yesterday
You're holdin' the key
When you believe it
[Chorus]
Shine sweet freedom
Shine your light on me
You are the magic
You're right where I want to be
Oh sweet freedom carry me along
We'll keep the spirit alive on and on
We'll be dancin' in the moonlight
Smilin' with the risin' sun
Livin' like we've never done
Goin' all the way
Reachin' out to meet the changes
Touchin' every shining star
The light of tomorrow is right where we are
There's no turnin' back
From what I'm feeling
[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be starlight all night
When we're close together
Share those feelings dancin' in your eyes
Tonight they're guiding us
Shinin' till the mornin' light
