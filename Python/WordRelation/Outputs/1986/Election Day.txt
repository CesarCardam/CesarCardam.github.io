86. Arcadiaalbum
Wild kind of look to the day,
Opening eyes impale neon flickers
She moon she turning away,
The city's her slave but he's cheating his mistress
She's moody and grey,
She's mean and she's restless (so restless)
All over you as they say
Rumours or rivals yell at the strike force
Hi guys, by the way, are you aware you're being illegal
It's making your savior behaviour look evil
Excuse my timing but say,
How d'you fit in with this flim, flam and Judy
Maximum big surprise your smile is something new
I pull my shirt off and pray,
We're sacred and bound to suffer the heatwave
Pull my shirt off and pray we're coming up on re-election day
