32. Janet JacksonDesign Of A Decade 1986/1996
Ooh, baby, anytime my world gets crazy
All I have to do
to calm it,
Is just think of you
'Cause when I think of you, baby,
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby,
All I think about is our love
I... just get My heart attached to you when
You hold me in your arms, and squeeze me
And you leave me making me blue
'Cause when I think of you, baby,
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby,
All I think about is our love
So in love (So in love)
Ooh (So in love)
With you (So in love)
Baby (So in love)Ooh (So in love)
Hee (So in love)With you (So in love)
(So in love)When I think of you...
(When I think of you)
When I think of you...
(When I think of you)
Bass
I'm...so in love
I just think of you
If you're not around
Oh
When I think of you (So in love)
Ooh (So in love)
So in love (So in love)
With you (So in love)
Baby ooh (So in love)
Ooh (So in love)
So in love (So in love)
