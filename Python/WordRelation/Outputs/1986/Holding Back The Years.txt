22. Simply RedPicture Book
Holding back the years
Thinking of the fear I've had for so long
When somebody hears
Listen to the fear that's gone
Strangled by the wishes of pater
Hoping for the arm of mater
Get to me sooner or later
Nothing ever could, yeah
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
Chance for me to escape from all I know
Holding back the tears
There's nothing here has grown
I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all those years
Nothing had the chance to be good
Nothing ever could, yeah
I'll keep holding on
