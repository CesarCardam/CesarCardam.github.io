94. Daryl Hallalbum
I saw you standing and I felt your rage
like a dark cloud on a crowded stage
You were talking through the smoke in your fantasy
I know you girl I know what to believe
Maybe things ain't been so good at home
And the people that you love never cared at all
You want to run away don't care where you go
You want to run away that's all you know
Believe it's alright to fantasize
And say the words you think will satisfy me
But you know better than that
'Cause you know what's a lie
