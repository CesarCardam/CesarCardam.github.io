37. Level 42Living It Up
Now, how can it be
That a love carved out of caring
Fashioned by fate could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often
But making mistakes is a part of life's imperfection
Born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all?
Drawn into the stream of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams, they can't disguise the truth
That there is something about you, baby, so right
I wouldn't be without you ,baby, tonight
If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things and a perfect dream of life (gone) fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
And it's not so wrong; we're only human after all
These changing years, they add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear the time that told the truth
Because, there's something about you, baby, so right
I wouldn't be without you, baby, tonight
Because there's something about you, baby, so right
I couldn't live without you, baby, tonight
Something about you, the way you are, so right
I wouldn't be without you here tonight
There's something about you, the way you are so right
I couldn't live without you here tonight
