15. Al Wilsonalbum
These are the eyes that never knew how to smile
Till you came into my life
And these are the arms that long to lock you inside
Every day and every night
Girl, and here is the soul of which you've taken control
Can't you see I'm trying to show love is right
Oh, show and tell
Just a game I play, when I want to say
I love you
Girl, so show me, and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, baby
These are the hands that can't help reaching for you
If you're anywhere inside (anywhere inside)
And these are the lips that can't help calling your name
In the middle of the night (middle of the night)
Oh, and here is the man that needs to know where you stand
Don't you know I've done all I can, so decide
Oh, show and tell
It's just a game I play, when I want to say
I love you
Girl, so show me, and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, say you do
Baby, baby, baby
Here is the soul of which you've taken control
Can't you see I'm trying to show love is right
Ooh, girl
Show and tell
Just a game I play, when I want to say
Oh, I love you
Girl, so show me, and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, say you do, baby
Oh, show and tell
Just a game I play, when I want to say
Oh, I love you
Girl, so show me, and tell me
That you feel the same way too
