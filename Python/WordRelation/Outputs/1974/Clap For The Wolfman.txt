Clap for the Wolfman
He gonna rate your record high
Clap for the Wolfman
You gonna dig him 'til the day you die
Clap for the Wolfman
He gonna rate your record high (hmm, yes gracious)
Clap for the Wolfman
You gonna dig him 'til the day you die
Do Ron Ron and the Duke of Earl
They were friend's of mine
The highway's on my moonlight drive
Snuggled in, said baby, just one kiss
She said no, no, no
Romance ain't keepin' me alive
I said hey babe, do you want to coo, coo, coo
She said uh, uh, uh
So I was left out in the cold
I said you're what I've been dreamin' of
She said I don't want to know
Oh you know, she was diggin' the cat on the radio
Clap for the Wolfman
He gonna rate your record high
Yes baby, I your doctor in love
Clap for the Wolfman
You gonna dig him til the day you die
Everybody talkin' about the Wolfman's confidence of love
Seventy five, eighty miles an hour
She hollers slow, slow, slow
Baby I can stop right on a dime
I said hey baby, give me just one kiss
She said no, no, no
But how was I to bide my time
I said hey baby, do you want to coo, coo, coo
She said uh, uh, uh
Said I'm about to overload
I said you're what I've been livin' for
She said I don't want to know
Oh, you thought she was digging you but she was digging me
Clap for the Wolfman
He gonna rate your record high
As long as you got the curves baby, I got the angles
Clap for the Wolfman
You gonna dig him 'til the day you die
It's all according to how your boogaloo situation stands, you understand
Clap for the Wolfman
He gonna rate your record high
You ain't gonna get 'em, 'cause I got 'em
Clap for the Wolfman
You gonna dig him 'til the day you die
You might want to try, but I'm gonna keep 'em
Clap for the Wolfman
Clap for the Wolfman
Clap for the Wolfman
Clap for the Wolfman
Clap for the Wolfman (and I got them all)
Clap for the Wolfman
Clap for the Wolfman
Clap for the Wolfman
Clap for the Wolfman
