77. Paul McCartney & WingsWingspan Hits &amp; History
(Jet, Jet)
(Jet) I can almost remember their funny faces
That time you told them you were going to marrying soon
And Jet I thought the only lonely place was on the moon
(Jet, Jet)
Jet was your father as bold as the sergeant major
How come he told you that you were hardly old enough yet
And Jet I thought the major was a lady suffragette
(Jet, Jet)
Ah mater want Jet to always love me
Ah mater want Jet to always love me
Ah mater, much later
(Jet)
And Jet I thought the major was a lady suffragette
(Jet, Jet)
Ah mater want Jet to always love me
Ah mater want Jet to always love me
Ah mater, much later
Jet with the wind in your hair
Of a thousand laces
Climb on the back and we'll go for a ride in the sky
And Jet I thought that the major was a little lady suffragette
(Jet, Jet)
And Jet you know I thought you was a little lady suffragette
(Jet)
A little lady
My little lady, yes
