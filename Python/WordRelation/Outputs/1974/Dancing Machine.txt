05. Jackson 5The Jacksons Story: Number 1&#039;s
Dancing, dancing, dancing
She's a dancing machine
Ah babe
Move it baby
Automatic Systematic
Full of color self contained
Tuned and channeled to your vibes
Captivating Stimulating
She such a sexy lady
Built with space age design
Shes moving grooving dancing to the music stop now
Yeah
Rhythmic acrobatic
She a dynamite attraction
At the drop of a coin she comes alive now
She knows what shes doing
She super bad now
She's geared to really blow your mind
Dancing, dancing, dancing
She's a dancing machine
Ah babe
Do it baby
Dancing, dancing, dancing
She's a dancing machine
Ah babe
Move it baby
Shes a dance, dance, dance, dance, dancing machine
Watch her get down, watch her get down
As she do, do, do her thing
Right on the scene
Shes a dance, dance, dance, dance, dancing machine
Watch her get down, watch her get down
As she do, do, do her thing
Right on the scene
Come on babe
