Having my baby
What a lovely way of saying
How much you love me.
Having my baby
What a lovely way of saying
What you're thinking of me.
I can see it your face is glowing
I can see it in your eyes.
I'm happy knowin' that you're having my baby.
You're the woman I love and I love what it's doin' to you.
Having my baby
You're a woman in love and I love
What's goin' through you.
The need inside you
I see it showin'
Oh
The seed inside you
Baby
Do you feel it growin'
Are you happy in knowin' that you're having my baby?
I'm a woman in love and I love
What it's doin' to me.
Having my baby.
I'm a woman in love and I love
What's goin' through me.
Didn't have to keep it
Wouldn't put you through it.
You could have swept it from your life
But you wouldn't do it
No
You wouldn't do it.
And you're having my baby.
I'm a woman in love and I love
