61. Johnny BristolHang on in There Baby
Hmmm! Hmmm! Yeah! Oh! Baby! Hmmm!
Hang on in there baby
Give me love tonight
Don't be afraid baby
You know we can't help but make it oh my love
You know we can't help but make it
Now that we've caressed a kiss so warm and tender
I can't wait till we reach that sweet moment of surrender
Oh we'll hear the thunder roar, feel the lightning strike
At a point we'll both decide to meet at the same time tonight
Hang on in there baby, hang on in there darling
I'm gonna give you more than you ever dreamed possible
Don't be afraid baby sweet virgin of the world
You know we can't help but make it
Because there's true love between us girl
Hmmm! so let us touch that cloud that everyone dreams of
Oh we're almost there darling truly making love
Hang on in there baby, please don't let me down
Please don't destroy this new joy
What's that now baby, what's that you say
Something's eating at you and it's hard to get away
Oh don't fight it baby just open up the door
Because that's the key to the freedom that we've both been working for
Let it go baby, let it go darling, oh! right there, right there
Baby don't you move it don't you dare
Go baby let it go honey oh right there baby don't you move it anywhere
Give it a stand (x3) up now fashion
Give it a jump (x3) up
Give it a jam (x3) give it a pull
Give me a love (x2) give me a little love
Hang on in there baby, hang on in there darling
Hang on in there now
I'm gonna give you more than you ever dreamed possible
Hang on in there darling
Hang on in there baby hang on in there baby
Please don't let me down hold it down
Please don't destroy this new joy
New joy we've found, new joy we've found
