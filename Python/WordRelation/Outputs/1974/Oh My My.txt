74. Ringo StarrBlast From Your Past
I phoned up my doctor
To see what's the matter
He said come on over,
I said do I have to?
My knees started shakin'
My wrist started achin'
When my doctor said to me
Oh my my, oh my my,
Can you boogie, can you slide
Oh my my, oh my my,
You can boogie, if you try
Oh my my, oh my my,
It's guaranteed to keep you alive
The head nurse,
She blew in, just like a tornado
When they started dancin',
I jumped off the table,
I felt myself healin', and I was leavin'
This is what they said to me
Oh my my, oh my my,
Can you boogie, can you slide
Oh my my, oh my my,
You can boogie, you can fly
Oh my my, if you try,
It's guaranteed to keep you alive
Now if you should slow down,
And you're feelin' low down,
Don't call up your doctor
Just grab you a partner
It's what you've been missin'
I've got your prescription
That boogie woogie remedy
Oh my my, oh my my,
You can you boogie, can you slide
Oh my my, oh my my,
We can boogie, 'till we die
Oh my my, if you try,
It's guaranteed to keep you alive
Oh my my, oh my my,
Watch me boogie, watch me fly
Oh my my, oh my my,
Born to boogie, born to slide
Oh my my, oh my my,
Ooh wee boogie, ooh wee I
Oh my my, oh my my,
Play that boogie, play that slide.
