66. Wet Williealbum
Well you say you got the blues,
Got holes in both of your shoes,
Feelin' alone and confused,
You got to keep on smilin', keep on smilin'
Yeah, you're about to go insane,
'Cause your woman's playing games
And she says that you're to blame,
You got to keep on smilin', keep on smilin'
Keep on smilin' through the rain, laughin' at the pain
Rollin' with the changes 'til the sun comes out again
Keep on smilin' through the rain, laughin' at the pain
Rollin' with the changes, singi'n this refrain
Singin' in a honky tonk cafe,
Nobody's hearin' what you play,
They're too busy drinkin' anyway,
You got to keep on smilin', brother keep on smilin'
You say you found a piece of land
Gonna change from city boy to country man
Try to build your life with your hands
You got to keep on smilin', keep on smilin'
Keep on smilin' through the rain, laughin' at the pain
Rollin' with the changes til the sun comes out again
Keep on smilin' through the rain, laughin' at the pain
Rollin' with the changes, singi'n this refrain
You're just hangin' out in a local bar,
And you're wonderin' who the hell you are
Are you a farmer or are you a star?
Keep on smilin' through the rain, laughin' at the pain
Rollin' with the changes til the sun comes out again
Keep on smilin' through the rain, laughin' at the pain
Rollin' with the changes, singi'n this refrain
