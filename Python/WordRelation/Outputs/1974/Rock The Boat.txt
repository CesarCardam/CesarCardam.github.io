43. Hues Corporationalbum
So I'd like to know where, you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where, you got the notion
(To rock the boat), don't rock the boat baby
(Rock the boat), don't tip the boat over
(Rock the boat), don't rock the boat baby
(Rock the boat)
Ever since our voyage of love began
Your touch has thrilled me like the rush of the wind
And your arms have held me safe from a rolling sea
There's always been a quiet place to harbor you and me
Our love is like a ship on the ocean
We've been sailing with a cargo full of love and devotion
So I'd like to know where, you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where, you got the notion
(To rock the boat), don't rock the boat baby
(Rock the boat), don't tip the boat over
(Rock the boat), don't rock the boat baby
(Rock the boat)
Up to now we sailed through every storm
And I've always had your tender lips to keep me warm
Oh, I need to have the strength that flows from you
Don't let me drift away my dear, when love can see me through
(Our love is like a ship on the ocean)
We've been sailing with a cargo full of love and devotion
So I'd like to know where, you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where, you got the notion
So I'd like to know where, you got the notion
Said I'd like to know where, you got the notion
(To rock the boat), don't rock the boat baby
(Rock the boat), don't tip the boat over
(Rock the boat), don't rock the boat, baby
(Rock the boat), don't tip the boat over
(Rock the boat) ooh-ooh
(Rock the boat) rock on with you, baby
(Rock the boat) rock on with you, baby
(Rock the boat) rock on with you, baby
(Rock the boat)
(Rock the boat)
(Rock the boat)
(Rock the boat)
(Rock the boat)
(Rock the boat)
(Rock the boat)
(Rock the boat)
(Rock the boat)
(Rock the boat)
(Rock the boat)
(Rock the boat)
(Rock the boat)
(Rock the boat)
