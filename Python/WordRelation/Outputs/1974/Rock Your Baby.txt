Sexy mama
Woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby
Woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby
There's nothing to it
Just say you wanna do it
Open up your heart
And let the loving start
Oh, woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby

Rock your baby
Yeah, hold me tight
With all your might
Now, let your loving flow
Real sweet and slow
Oh, woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby
Woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby
Oh, woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby
Woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby
Oh, woman, take me in your arms
And rock me
Ah woman, take me in your arms
And rock me, ahh
