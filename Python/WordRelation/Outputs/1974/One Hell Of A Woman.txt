10. Mac DavisI Sing the Hits
She's a woman
She's a baby
She's a witch
She's a lady
She's a free and gentle spirit
She can be what she wants to be
And if she wants to be with me tonight
That's alright
She's one hell of a woman
Young, strong and tame
But soft when she loves me
Like a gentle kitten in my hand
She makes me feel
Like a hell of a man
She's wild, warm and tender
She'll resist then she'll surrender
She's a free and gentle spirit
She can be what she wants to be
And if she wants to be with me tonight
Well that's alright
She's one hell of a woman
Young, strong and tame
But soft when she loves me
Like a gentle kitten in my hand
She makes me feel
Like a hell of a man
