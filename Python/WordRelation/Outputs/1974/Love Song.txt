80. Anne MurrayThe Best...So Far
There's a wren in a willow wood
Flys so high and sings so good
And he brings to you, what he sings to you
Like my brother the wren and I
Well, he told if I try, I could fly for you
And I want to try for you, 'cause
I want to sing you a love song
I want to rock you in my arms all night long
I want to get to know you
I want to show you, the peaceful feelin' of my home
Summer thunder on moon-bright days
Northern Lights and skies ablaze
And I bring to you, lover, when I sing to you
Silver wings in a fiery sky
Show the trail of my love and I
Sing to you, love is what I bring to you
And I want to sing to you, oh
I want to sing you a love song
I want to rock you in my arms all night long
I want to get to know you
I want to show you, the peaceful feelin' of my home
Brief interlude
I want to sing you a love song
I want to rock you in my arms all night long
I want to get to know you
I want to show you, the peaceful feelin' of my home
I want to show you, the peaceful feelin' of my home
