42. Three Dog Nightalbum
Baby, although I chose this lonely life
It seems it's stranglin' me now
All the wild men, big cigars, gigantic car
They're all laughin' at the lie
Oh, I've been used Ooh-oh-oh-oh
I've been a fool, oh, what a fool
I broke all the rules Oh, yeah
But I must let the show go on
Baby, there's an enormous crowd of people
They're all after my blood
I wish maybe they'd tear down the walls of this theater
Let me out, let me out
Oh, I'm so blind, oh, I'm blind
I wasted time wasted, wasted, wasted time
Walkin' on the wire, high wire
But I must let the show go on
Oh, I'm so blind, oh, I'm blind
I wasted time, wasted, wasted, all too much time
Walkin' on the wire, high wire
But I must let the show go on
Baby, I wish you'd help me escape
Help me get away
Leave me outside my address
Far away from this masquerade
'Cause I've been blind, oh, so blind
I wasted time, wasted, wasted, all too much time
Walkin' on the wire, high wire
But I must let the show go
I must let the show go
I must let the show go on
