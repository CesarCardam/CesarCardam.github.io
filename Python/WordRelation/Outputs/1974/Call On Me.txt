98. ChicagoGreatest Hits (Chicago IX)
The feelin' was clear
Clear as a blue sky on a Sunday day
Everything was you, woah oh
'Cause no one made me feel
The way I felt with you, oh oh
Call on me 'cause
I love you
You know I do
You love me too
Then came a change
When I said I would soon be leavin' you
Nothin' else to do
Please remember I never lose the thought of you
Call on me 'cause
I love you
You know I do
You love me too
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You've got to find
Someone else to somehow take my place
Share his life with you, woah oh
But if you need a friend
You can always count on me
Count on me 'cause
I love you
You know I do
You love me too
You can count on me oh
You can count on me
You can count on me baby
You can count on me
You can count on me oh
You can count on me
You can count on me baby
You can count on me
You can count on me oh
You can count on me
You can count on me baby
You can count on me
You can count on me oh
You can count on me
You can count on me baby
You can count on me
