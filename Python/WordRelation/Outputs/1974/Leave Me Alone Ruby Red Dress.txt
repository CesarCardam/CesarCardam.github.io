71. Helen Reddyalbum
Big ole ruby red dress wanders round the town
Talkin' to herself now, sometimes sitten down
Don't you get too close now, ruby runs away
Poor ole ruby red dress born on a sorry day
I can hear her say
[Chorus]
Leave me alone, won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone now, leave me alone
Leave me alone, please leave me alone, yes leave me
Leave me alone won't you leave me alone
Please leave me alone, no leave me alone
Leave me along, just leave me alone, oh leave me
Big ole ruby red dress, everybody laughs
Say she's got no future and never made no past
Something hurt that ruby, shomething she can't bear
Ya look at her real close now, you see a little tear
When she says now
[Chorus]
Some folks say some farm boy up from Tennessee
Taught it all to Ruby, then just let her be
Her daddy tried to hide it, tried to keep things cool
But something happened to Ruby, she broke down to a fool
Who just said now
[Chorus]
