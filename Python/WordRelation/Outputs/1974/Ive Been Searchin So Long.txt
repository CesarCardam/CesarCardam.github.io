73. ChicagoGreatest Hits (Chicago IX)
As my life goes on I believe
Somehow something's changed
Something deep inside
Ooh a part of me
There's a strange new light in my eyes
Things I've never known
Changing my life
Changing me
I've been searchin'
So long
To find an answer
Now I know my life has meaning<
Now I see myself as I am
Feeling very free
Life is everything
Ooh it's meant to be
When my days have come to an end
I will understand
What I left behind
Part of me
I've been searching
So long
To find and answer
Now I know my life has meaning
Woah woah
Searching
(don't you know I'm)
For an answer
To the question,
Oh yeah
"who am I?"
Maybe
Maybe it's true
It's only natural
(it's only natural baby, yeah)
Good things
In life
Take a long time
Yeah yeah
