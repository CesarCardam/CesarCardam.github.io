Your love is wonderful, yeah
And I don't wanna lose you
So, baby, soon as I get home I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Sleepless nights and lonely days are all that fill my head all of the time, oh baby
But all I do is think about the way you make me feel
'cause, baby, this love is so real,
Soon as I get home I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
If I try to spend some time with you to make you happy,
would you feel better?
And if I could, with you I would be forever, forever in love, so in love
Making love all through the night, we could hold each other tight
I can take away the pain if you would only let me
Just forget about the past 'cause I want to make it last
Baby, I apologize 'cause, boy, I really need you in my life
Soon as I get home I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Baby, if you give me just another chance, I can show you love
Promise I'll be true to you
Don't have to worry 'cause I'm gonna treat you right
Baby, I miss you, just wanna kiss you, hold you in my arms tonight
Soon as I get home, baby, I know what I gotta do 'cause
I don't need no one but you
Soon as I get home, baby, I know what I gotta do 'cause
I don't need no one but you
Soon as I get home, baby, I know what I gotta do
