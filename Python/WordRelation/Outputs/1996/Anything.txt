I'll give you love, the things you want
Ooh, and I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
Sitting at home another lonely night
Wish you were here so I could hold you tight
Pain in my heart because I'm all alone
Why did you leave, why did your love have to go?
And I would do anything for you, I would
Thinkin' of ways that I can win your heart
But I'm so confused, I don't know where to start
Visions of love forever in my mind
I wait for the day when I could say that girl's mine
'Cause I would do anything for you, yes, I would
I'll give you love
(I'll give you love)
The things you want
(The things you want)
Baby, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
So what can I do to prove I need your love?
What will it take because I won't give up
Open your heart and let your feelings show
'Cause deep down inside my heart just won't let you go
Girl, I would do anything for you, yes, I would
I'll give you love
(I'll give you love)
The things you want
(The things you want)
Baby, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
So if there ever comes a time
When it's true love you hope to find
Just call out my name
And girl, I swear, I would do anything
I'll give you love
I'll give you love, oh, I'll give you love, girl
I'll give you love, oh, I'll give you love, girl
I'll give you love, oh, I'll give you love, girl
I'll give you love, oh, I'll give you love
I would do anything for you
(I swear I would do, babe)
I would do anything for you
(Anything for you, babe)
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
I said I give you love, baby
(I'll give you love)
Oh, anything you want, my baby
(The things you want)
Girl, I'll give, I'll give, I'll give, I'll give, I'll give it to you
See, I would do anything for you
(I swear I will do, babe)
I would do anything for you
(Anything for you, babe)
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
(Anything, girl, anything for you)
I'll give you love
(I'll give you love)
Oh, I'll give you love
(The things you want)
I swear I'll give you love, babe
I would do anything for you
(I swear I would do, babe)
I would do anything for you
(Anything you want me)
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
I'll give you love
