14. Whitney HoustonThe Ultimate Collection
Everyone falls in love sometimes
Sometimes it's wrong, and sometimes it's right
For every win, someone must fail
But there comes a point when
When we exhale yeah, yeah, say
Shoop, shoop, shoop shoop be doop,
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop (all you gotta do is say)
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Sometimes you'll laugh, sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, the when's or why's
When you've got friends, to wish you well
You'll find your point when, you will exhale (yeah, yeah, say)
Shoop, shoop, shoop shoop be doop,
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Hearts are often broken
When there are words unspoken
In your soul there's answers to your prayers
If you're searching for a place you know
A familiar face, somewhere to go
You should look inside yourself
You're halfway there
Sometimes you'll laugh, sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us, the when's or why's
But when you've got friends, to wish you well
You'll find your point when
You will exhale (yeah, yeah, say)
Shoop, shoop, shoop shoop be doop,
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoop be doop
