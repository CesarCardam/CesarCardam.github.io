Oh ooh ooh, yeah
I've been doing my own thing
Love has always had a way of having bad timing
But to my great surprise
Ever since I looked in your eyes
I had one question for you
Tell me if you want me to
Give you all my time
I want to make it good for you
'Cause you blow my mind
I promise boy that I'll be true
You're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to
Yeah
If you thought I'd sleep on this
Boy, you're wrong 'cause all I dream about is
Our first kiss
And you're the first one to make me feel like this
And this is one opportunity that I can't resist, no no
Boy you want to know the deal
You are wondering if the words I'm saying are for real
'Cause you got more appeal
Than any man in this whole world
And baby I got to know how you feel
Tell me if you want me to
Give you all my time
I want to make it good for you
'Cause you blow my mind
I promise boy that I'll be true
You're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to
Sweetheart now it's time I let you know
I don't want to rush
We should take it slow
Boy, I can love you, can you help me grow
Give me a new beginning
All my love, please tell me if you want me to
(I want you to, I want you tchu doo doo)
I wanna make it good, I wanna make it good to you baby
So won't tell me, tell me oh ow hoh
(Tell me if you want me to
I wanna make it good to you
I just gonna have to
So tell me
Tell me if you want to do
Tell me if you want me to
Boy I wanna make it good for you
I promise boy that I'll be true
Tell me if you want me to
Tell me if you want me to
I promise boy that I'll be true
