08. Donna LewisBrand New Day
Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists of pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you
Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer night air
Secret moments shared in the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness
Soft spoken words
Say it, say it again
I love you always forever
Near and far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there under blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness a magical time
Say it, say it again
I love you always forever
Near and far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything
I love you always forever
Near and far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
