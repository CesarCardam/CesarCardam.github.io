16. Brandyalbum
Whoa, ooh
Seems like ever since
The first day we met
There is no one else I think of more than you
I can't seem to forget
Can't get you out my head
Cause the verdicts in
I'm crazy over you
How can one be down?
Tell me where to start
Cause every time you smile
I feel tremors in my heart
I have but one concern
How can I get with you?
Till my day comes here's what I'm gonna do.
Be sitting up in my room
Back here thinking 'bout you
I must confess I'm a mess for you
Be sitting up in my room
Back here thinking 'bout you
I'm just a mess with a plan for you
Pray that you'll invest
In my happiness
All it takes is just one simple call from you
Turn my heart around
If I'm making ground
Pretty baby please tell me if I'm getting through
Tell me what is up
You see I need to know
Tell if I'm far or if I'm getting close
I have but one concern
And one concern is you
Till I'm with you here's what I'm gonna do
Be sitting up in my room
Back here thinking 'bout you
I must confess I'm a mess for you
Be sitting up in my room
Back here thinking 'bout you
I'm just a mess with a plan for you
Ooh whoa, oh yeah, oh yeah
Hmm, oh, oh, oh
How can one be down?
Tell me where to start
Cause every time you smile
I feel tremors in my heart
I have but one concern
How can I get with you?
Till my day comes here's what I'm gonna do
Be sitting up in my room
Back here thinking 'bout you
I must confess I'm a mess for you
Be sitting up in my room
Back here thinking 'bout you
I'm just a mess with a plan for you
Be sitting up in my room
Back here thinking 'bout you
I must confess I'm a mess for you
Be sitting up in my room
Back here thinking 'bout you
I'm just a mess with a plan for you
Pray that you'll invest
In my happiness
All it takes is just one simple call from you
Turn my heart around
If I'm making ground
Pretty baby please tell me if I'm getting through
Tell me what is up
You see I need to know
Tell if I'm far or if I'm getting close
I have but one concern
And one concern is you
Till I'm with you here's what I'm gonna do
Be sitting up in my room
Back here thinking 'bout you
I must confess I'm a mess for you
Be sitting up in my room
Back here thinking 'bout you
I'm just a mess with a plan for you
