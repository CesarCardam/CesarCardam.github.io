67. BodeansGo Slow Down
Everybody wants to live, like they wanna live and
Everybody wants to love, like they wanna love and
Everybody wants to be
Closer to Free
Everybody wants respect
Just a little bit
And everybody needs a chance once in awhile
Everybody wants to be
Closer to Free
Everybody one, everybody two, everybody free
Everybody needs to touch, you know, now and then
And everybody wants a good, good friend
Everybody wants to be
Closer to Free
I said everybody one, everybody two, everybody free
Everybody wants to live
Like they wanna live and
Everybody wants to love like they wanna love and
Everybody wants to be
Closer to Free
Yeah, Closer to Free
Yeah, Closer to Free
Closer to Free
