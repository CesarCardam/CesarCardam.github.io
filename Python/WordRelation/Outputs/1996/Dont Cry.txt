Don't be so hard on yourself
Those tears are for someone else
I hear your voice on the phone
I hear you feel so alone
My baby
Oh my baby
Please my baby
My baby
When we were young
And truth was paramount
We were older then,
And we lived a life without any doubt
Those memories,
They seem so long ago
What's become of them? (They've all gone for sure)
When you feel like me I want you to know
Don't cry
Not alone
Don't cry tonight, my baby
Don't cry you'll always be loved
Don't cry tonight my baby
Today I dreamed
Of friends I had before
And I wonder why
The ones who care don't call anymore
My feelings hurt
But you know I overcome the pain
And I'm stronger now
There can't be a fire unless there's a flame
Don't cry
Your not alone
Don't cry tonight, my baby
Don't cry you'll always be loved
Don't cry oh
Limousines and sycophants
Don't leave me now,
'Cause I'm afraid what you've done to me
Is now the wolf
In my bed
In my head
In my head
In my head
The challenges, we took were hard enough
They get harder now
Even when we think that we've had enough
Don't feel alone,
'Cause it's I you understand
I'm your sedative,
Take a piece of me whenever you can
Don't cry you're not alone (don't be so hard on yourself)
Don't cry tonight my baby (these tears are for someone else)
Don't cry you'll always be loved (I hear your voice on the phone)
Don't cry tonight sweet baby (I hear you fear so alone)
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't you cry, cry
Don't cry 'cause you still be loved
Don't cry
Don't cry tonight, oh
My baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby
My baby, my baby, my baby
Don't cry tonight
You'll still be loved
