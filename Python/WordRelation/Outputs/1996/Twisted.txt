Oh yeah baby
You got to make your mind up
Yeah, Kut Klose, hear me out
You know you are my lover
You got me twisted over you
I know I got what you need
So what you want to do
Baby, baby I know
Baby I love you so
But you don't feel like I do
Tell me what can I do
But I gotta be strong
You did me wrong
When I thought that we were really down
So you say you want me
Make up your mind
'Cause I'm not gonna be here for long
Baby, baby in time
Baby I know you'll find
That what you needed was here
And think about it my dear
(rpt 2, 1...)
Breaking up down
You got me twisted
Thinking about the way that things use to be
When It was you and me girl I was so free
See you had my life
Like Cupid and I was just down right foolish and stupid
But now I know the reason for the pain and the headaches
You left me all alone now I can't even concentrate
I guess I'll wait for the day until you come back
Because my heart is where your love is at
You got me twisted
(Repeat 1, 1)
