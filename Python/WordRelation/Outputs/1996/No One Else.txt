There you are
Lookin' at me
Tell me what'cha want
This to be
It could be everything
That your heart desires
All you gotta do
Is stick around for awhile
There's so many things
That I wanna do
Take you all around
It's all up to you
If you take my hand
And just follow me
There's no tellin'
What we can be
Just you and me yeah
I don't need
No one else but you
Tell me what you
Want me to do
I don't need
No one else but you
You gotta believe me
Cuz what I say is true
Could ya be
All that I need
Show me what I
Need to see
If it's all right with you
Tell me now baby
We can take this
All the way
Just tell me how
There's so many things
That I wanna do
Take you all around
It's all up to you
If you take my hand
And just follow me
There's no tellin'
What we can be
Just you and me yeah
I don't need
No one else but you
Tell me what you
Want me to do
I don't need
No one else but you
You gotta believe me
Cuz what I say is true
If ya wanna just
Take your time
I'll understand
Just tell me why
If it's all right
Wit' you I'll let
You lead the way
No need to wait baby
Don't hesitate
I don't need
No one else but you
Tell me what you
Want me to do
I don't need
No one else but you
You gotta believe me
Cuz what I say is true
