21. LL Cool JMr Smith
Keep it chicken head, I'm lookin' for a dime
Get my swerve on, make it hot, word is bond,
I'm lickin' on your ankle
Bracelet, we'll be sippin' Moet with strawberries and dat shit,
I'm nasty ask me
Why I lick my lips so in the darkness
I can run my tongue over your tits
Its all good sugary, you ain't leavin' sit up on my face
and help my stash grow
Even whipped cream taste mean from the back
she bounce with' LL now shorty's on the map
I put away the gat, took off the hat,
throw ya mo's in the air if you like it like that
No doubt boo, I keep it real girl, mad pleasure,
blowin' up your whole world
Whatever's clever I got endless cash,
trees from Hawaii, 2 pools or baths
[Chorus]
I'll be loungin' with LL Cool J
I'll be loungin' with LL, hey hey
Uh, my scenario is grand, a dime piece,
hennessey up in my hand
I turn out the lights like teddy,
I'm feenin', standin' in the darkness, now I'm ready
Oh yeah up in ya, let it flow while I pump slow,
then I speed it up, heat it up
Make it mo' tasty, so you can swing low and lace me
Use your imagination, you do me, I do you, sex education
Its all good, it's cranberry absolut, peach shnapps,
feelin' tipsy, loungin' on the rooftops
I'm 'bout to spank you on dat ass(ooh)
I know you love it when it lasts(true) when
You need it who you ask (you)
what you sayin' when I dash (don't go boo)
[Chorus]
You got to bounce with me suga, word up,
you got to bounce with me suga, worda
Worda, word up
Warm it up sugar, make it hot, shorties'll swarm,
make me want to bust shots,
we speak daily on the regular,
run your jibs all day chip in my cellular
Shoot down to Jamaica, pretty white sand,
suntan oil, pina' coladas in my hand
Laying up at night, peepin' at stars,
remember, when we was at the club in the bars?
I told ya my status was that of a don,
you thought I was a dog and you ain't want to
Get it on, but my mind has attractin' qualities,
all the emotions of a young lady
So here you are, smack dab up in the mix,
shorty this here's about as good as it gets
Word up, I'ma treat you like a queen from the heart,
crack the bubbly, and let the
Episode start.
[Chorus]
