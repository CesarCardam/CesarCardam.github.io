63. Case Featuring Foxxy BrownCase
You're the only one for me, you're the only one I need
Can't nobody make me feel, the way you're making me feel
And girl you know this love is real
Touch me, tease me, feel me and caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go
Baby I'm about to explode
'Cause all my love you can control
I'll spend the night with you, if you promise you will do
All the things to make me scream
And you know just what I mean
'Cause tonight youth is like ice cream
I want to make you fall in love
Make you touch the stars above
Please me low and be my friend
I'll come back and hit it again
And again, and again, and again, don't go away
