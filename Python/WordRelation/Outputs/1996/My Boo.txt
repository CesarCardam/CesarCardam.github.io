88. Ghost Town Dj'salbum
Boy you should know that
I've got you on my mind
Your secret admirer
I've been watching you
At night, I think of you
I want, to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on, give me a call boo
If your lovin's strong, gonna give my all to you
At night, I think of you
I want, to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on, give me a call boo
If your lovin's strong, gonna give my all to you
Every day I pray my heart can win
Every night I pray I can call you my man (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need you, I want you, to have you, hold you, squeeze you
So I'm going out, every weekend
Just to see my boo again
