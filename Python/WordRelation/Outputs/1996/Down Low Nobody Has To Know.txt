35. R. KellyThe Essential R. Kelly
Listen girl, you want me but he needs you
Yet you're tellin' me that everything is cool
Tryin' to convince me baby to do as you say
Just go along and see things your way
And keep it on the down low, whispering nobody has to know (nobody, nobody)
We can keep it on the down low (yeah), whispering nobody has to know (nobody knows)
Secret lovers is what you wanna be (yeah)
While making love to him, girl you're silently calling on me
What is a man to do in a situation like this? (I don't know, I don't know)
I feel there is something that I don't wanna miss (yeah)
And keep it on the down low(down low), girl nobody, nobody has to know
We can keep it on the down low (you better keep it, keep it), nobody has to know (nobody knows)
Beautiful you are but you're his by far
Comin' by my way drivin' his fancy car
Making plans to be in my life forever
Tell me, tell me that we'll always be together
And keep it on the down low, nobody has to know (no, no)
We can keep it on the down low (on the down low), nobody has to know (nobody has to know)
Listen babe I won't whisper a word
Nobody, nobody
How can you go so low so low
Keep it on the down low
No, no, no nobody nobody nobody
Keep it on the down low
On the down low baby
Nobody has to know
