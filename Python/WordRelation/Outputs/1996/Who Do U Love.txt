Last night I slept alone, I stayed at home
For the first time since you've been gone, babe
No friends to understand, to lend a helping hand
To ease the greatest pain I've ever known
How you walk away so easily
Still remains a mystery to me
Don't you remember that you promised me
Yes, you promised me, that you'd never leave, boy
But you went away, baby, and It's such a shame
How could you turn you back on me, oh
[Chorus:]
If you really don't want me, if you don't want me
If you really don't need me, if you don't need me,
If you really don't love me, tell me who do you love?
If you really don't want me, if you don't want me
If you really don't need me, if you don't need me
If you really don't love me, then who do you love?
I gave you babe everything, a man could ever need,
I was there whenever you would call, baby,
But somehow your feelings changed, and you don't act the same
I guess you're not the man that I once knew at all
How you walk away so easily
Still remains a mystery to me
Don't you remember that you promised me
Yes, you promised me, that you'd never leave, boy
Now the love is gone, babe
Tell me what went wrong
How could you leave me hanging on, oh baby
[Chorus]
I once was blind, but baby, now I'm seeing
That I'm not the one, who can fill your every need
I painted a picture so clear, it's reality
Now I know, yes, I know that, you're not the one for me
Ohhhhh, baby...
[Chorus]
How you walk away so easily
Still remains a mystery to me
Don't you remember that you promised me
Yes, you promised me, that you'd never leave, boy
How could you walk away from me?
Baby, if you promised you'd never leave
Been so long since you've been gone
The greatest thing I've ever known
[Chorus]
