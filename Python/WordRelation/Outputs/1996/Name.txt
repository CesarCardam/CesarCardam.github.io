24. Goo Goo DollsA Boy Named Goo
Even though the moment passed me by, I still can't turn away
All the dreams you never thought you'd lose got tossed along the way
Letters that you never meant to send lost or thrown away
Now we're grown up orphans that never knew their names
We don't belong to no one
That's a shame
If you could hide inside me, maybe for awhile,
and I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name
Scars are souvenirs you never lose, the past is never far
And did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
Don't make you sad to know that life is more than who you are?
Grew up way too fast and now there's nothing to believe
Reruns all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio,
And I won't tell 'em your name
And I won't tell 'em your name
And I won't tell 'em your name
I think about you all the time, but I don't need the same
It's lonely where you are
Come back down and I won't tell 'em your name
