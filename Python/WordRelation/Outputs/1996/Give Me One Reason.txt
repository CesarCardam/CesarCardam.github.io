Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Said I don't want leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind
Baby I got your number, oh and I know that you got mine
But you know that I called you, I called too many times
You can call me baby, you can call me anytime
But you got to call me
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Said I don't want leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind
I don't want no one to squeeze me, they might take away my life
I don't want no one to squeeze me, they might take away my life
I just want someone to hold me, oh and rock me through the night
This youthful heart can love you, yes and give you what you need
I said this youthful heart can love you, oh and give you what you need
But I'm too old to go chasing you around
Wasting my precious energy
Give me one reason to stay here
Yes, and I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
Oh, and I'll turn right back around
Said I don't want leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind
Baby just give me one reason, oh, give me just one reason why
Baby just give me one reason, oh, give me just one reason why I should stay
Said I told you that I loved you
And there ain't no more to say
