95. Take ThatGreatest Hits
I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh yeah
Got fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now
Whatever I said, whatever I did,
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good
Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story (no no)
It wasn't good (no no)
But in a corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find) a little room inside for me
Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) see, I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good
And we'll be together
This time is forever (forever)
We'll be fighting, and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again
Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good
Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good) I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong (whenever I'm wrong)
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
I want you back (want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See, I want you back for good
Oh yeah
I guess now it's time that you came back for good
