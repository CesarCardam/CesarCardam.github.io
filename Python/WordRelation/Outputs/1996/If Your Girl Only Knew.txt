Aaliyah, sing
If your girl only knew
That you was trying to get with me (what would she do)
If your girl only knew
That you was dissin' her to talk to me
She would probably leave (probably leave)
You alone (you alone)
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad (oh yeah)
That you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry
If your girl only knew
That I would want
To kick it with you (if she knew)
And if your girl could only see
How you be calling me, getting fresh with me
She would probably leave (leave)
You alone (you alone)
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone
And then she wouldn't have to worry
She's crazy to put up with you
Oh boy I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me
But it's dumb to put up with you
I won't be no fool
Let you like what you see
It ain't easy to get with me
She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad (she'd be glad)
That you was gone (that you was gone)
And then she wouldn't have to worry
She would probably leave
You alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone (that you was gone)
And then she wouldn't have to worry
She would probably leave (if your girl only knew)
You alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad (if your girl only knew)
That you was gone (that you was gone)
And then she wouldn't have to worry
If your girl only knew

If your girl only knew

(What you saying, what you saying, what you saying, huh?)
(What you saying huh)
If your girl only knew
(What you saying, what you saying, what you saying, huh?)
