55. JoeAll That I Am
Hey love
You say you need someone
To be there for you
To love you all night long
It's kinda funny but
I don't think you have to look no further
Because I'm right here
And I'm ready
To do all the things your man won't do
Tell me what kind of man
Would treat his woman so cold
Treat you like you're nothin'
When you're worth more than gold
Girl to me you're like a diamond
I love the way you shine
A hundred million dollar treasure
I'll give the world to make you mine
(La, la, la, la, la)
I'll put a string a pearls right in your hand
Make love on a beach of jet black sand
Outside in the rain we can do it all night
Out to tour the places he would not
And some you never knew would get you hot
Nothin' is forbidden when we touch
Baby, I want to do
All of the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you (Whoa)
Baby, I want to do (Hey)
All of (All of) the things your man won't do (Every little thing)
I'll do them for you (Yeah)
I'll take you out on a night cruise
On a yacht, just can't lose
'Cause we got a lot to look forward to
1-2, what ya gonna do
What good is a diamond nobody can see
I hear he got you on lock down
But I got the master key
(La, la, la, la, la)
I'll light a thousand candles all around
Show me to the subway, I'll go down
Nothin' can be sweeter than the sound of makin' love
Baby, when I start I just can't stop
I'll love you from the bottom to the top
Nothin' is forbidden when we touch
Baby (Baby), I want to do (Hey)
All of the things your man won't do (Every little)
I'll do them for you (Oh)
Baby, I want to do (I want to do, yeah)
All of the things your man won't do (Oh)
I'll do them for you (Yeah)
And oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh
(La, la, la, la, la)
I'll light a thousand candles all around
Show me to the subway, I'll go down
Nothin' can be sweeter than the sound of makin' love
Baby, when I start I just can't stop
I'll love you from the bottom to the top
Nothin' is forbidden when we touch, ooh, yeah
Baby, I want to do (Oh)
All of the things your man won't do (I'm gonna, I'm gonna, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'll do them for you (Ho)
Sweet baby (Baby), I want to do (I want to do)
All of the things your man won't do (And oh, yeah)
I'll do them for you
Ooh, I got a Jones in my bones for you
There ain't a damn thing that I won't do
I'll make your body cream with my sex machine
I won't stop until I hear your mother scream
Baby, I want to do (I want to do)
All of the things your man won't do (Whoa, oh, oh, ho, ah, yeah, yeah, hm)
I'll do them for you
Baby, I want to do (Wanna do)
All of the things your man won't do (Yeah, whoa, whoa)
I'll do them for you (I want to do it for you, baby)
Sweet baby, I want to do
All of the (Oh, whoa) things your man won't do
I'll do them for you
Baby I want to do (Oh, yeah)
All of the things your man won't do (Oh, yeah)
I'll do them for you
Sweet baby, I want to do
All of the things your man won't do
I'll do them for you
