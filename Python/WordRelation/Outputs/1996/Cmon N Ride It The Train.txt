I wanna take you home with me, to be alone with me
And I can see you wanna hide it, come on, just divide it
And please don't knock it, until you ride it

Graduated from Booze, up to allazay
Baby, you looking tough to death
Got your weave done right, it's on so tight
Now it's on tonight, yeah, yeah
Right about now it's about that time for me to holler
Girl, I wanna waller in the back of my Impala
Woo, don't need no tickets for this thing
Just jump on in, let me hit them switches on the train
And it ain't no thing, it's all the same
Get on the train tracks
Here we go, so get on the floor
And put a hump in your back
So pack your bags, come on, get ready, say what?
We're coming through your town
Move your arm up and down
And make that choo choo sound, like this
Ride that Choo Choo, woo woo
Come on it's the Choo Choo, woo woo
Come on it's the Choo Choo train
If you feel like dancing
Well come on, it's up to you
We got the sound to keep you getting down, down
The train is coming through
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I think I can, I think I can
I think I can, I think I can
