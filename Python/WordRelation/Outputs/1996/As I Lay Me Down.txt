76. Sophie B. Hawkinsalbum
It felt like Springtime on this February morning
In a courtyard birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel
All right I carry them with me today now
As I lay me down to sleep this I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away I'll whisper your name
Into the sky, and I will wake up happy
I wonder why
I feel so high, though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy-hearted till you call my name and it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train on a Summer evening
I want to meet you barefoot, barely breathing
As I lay me down to sleep this I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away I'll whisper your name
Into the sky, and I will wake up happy
(Hold out this hand) as I lay me down to sleep this I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away I'll whisper your name
Into the sky, and I will wake up happy
It's not too near for me, like a flower I need the rain
Thought it's not clear to me every season has its change
And I will see you when the sun comes out again
As I lay me down to sleep this I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away I'll whisper your name
Into the sky, and I will wake up happy
Oh, only as I lay me down to sleep this I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away I'll whisper your name
Into the sky, and I will wake up happy
I wonder why
When the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out
Oh, when the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out again
Ooh, ooh, comes out, comes out
Oh, wake up happy
'Cause I pray
Comes out, here we go again
Ooh, here we go again, baby
