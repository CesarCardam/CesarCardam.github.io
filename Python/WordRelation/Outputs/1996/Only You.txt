34. 112 Featuring The Notorious B.I.G.album
Oh I need to know,
Where we stand,
Do we share this special thing called love,
I know I do,
What about you,
I just can't get enough of the time
I need you in my life,
Where do we go,
What do I do,
I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you,
Makes me feel,
Like I am the only one for you,
Girl I want to be with you,
No one else,
Only you,
Why can't we just,
Make it happen,
Baby, I need you in my life
Every time I'm with you,
Never want it to come to an end (thought I told you that we won't stop),
You always make me so happy,
You'll always have a place in my heart
I need you in my life,
Where do we go,
What do I do,
I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you,
Makes me feel,
Like I am the only one for you,
Where do I go,
What must I do,
If I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel, baby,
Like I am the only one for you,
Girl I want to be with you,
No one else,
Only you,
Why can't we just,
Make it happen,
Baby, I need you in my life
