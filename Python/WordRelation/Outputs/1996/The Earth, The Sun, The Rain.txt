54. Color Me Baddalbum
When I was lost,
I could not see all the beauty and wonder wrapping around me.
I was alone dreaming of you.
Oh, I could not imagine this dream coming true.
So much joy now in all that I touch.
You make me feel ev'ry thing so much.
I will love you for the earth at my feet.
I will love you for the sun in the sky.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, hoh.
I will love you for the heart that could break.
I will love you for the dreams that we share.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, hoh.
Facing the wind, tears from my eyes.
Baby, where have you been?
But I was always waiting for you to pull back the dawn,
to take me by the hand and lead me through.
This whole world lies a stranger to me.
Now you have open my heart to ev'rything.
I will love you for the earth at my feet.
I will love you for the sun in the sky.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, hoh.
I will love you for the heart that could break.
I will love you for the dreams that we share.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, yeah.
Like a whisper in a dream
you have walked softly into my life
with love and sweet emotion.
And as I gaze into your eyes
I see the beauty that God has created , and I love you,
girl, now and forever.
I will love you for the earth at my feet.
I will love you for the sun in the sky.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, hoh
I will love you for the heart that could break.
I will love you for the dreams that we share.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, hoh
I will love you for the earth at my feet.
I will love your for the sun in the sky.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, hoh
I will love you for the heart that could break.
I will love you for the dreams that we share.
I will love you for the falling rain, hoh, hoh
