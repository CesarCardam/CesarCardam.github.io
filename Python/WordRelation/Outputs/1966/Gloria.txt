80. Shadows Of KnightLive 1966
Like to tell you 'bout my baby
You know she comes round
Just 'bout five feet four
From her head to the ground
Well she comes around here
Just about midnight
She makes me feel so good Lord
Makes me feel alright.
Her name is G-L-O-R-I-A
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria... [etc]
Yeah, she comes around here
Just about midnight
Makes me feel so good Lord
Makes me feel alright
Walkin' down my street
Comes up to my house
She knocks upon me door
Makes me feel alright.
Her name is G-L-O-R-I-A
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria... [etc]
