95. Bobby Fuller Fouralbum
I'm breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I left my baby and I feel so sad
I guess my race is run
But she's the best girl I've ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
Robbin' people with a six-gun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I miss my baby and the good fun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I left my baby and I feel so sad
I guess my race is run
But she's the best girl I've ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
