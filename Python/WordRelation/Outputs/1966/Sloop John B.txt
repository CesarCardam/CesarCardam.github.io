We come on the sloop john be
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night
Got into a fight
Well I feel so broke up
I want to go home
So hoist up the john be	's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home, let me go home
I want to go home, yeah yeah
Well I feel so broke up
I want to go home
The first mate he got drunk
And broke in the cap'n's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff john stone
Why don't you leave me alone, yeah yeah
Well I feel so broke up I want to go home
So hoist up the john be	's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home, let me go home
I want to go home, let me go home
Why don't you let me go home
(hoist up the john be	's sail)
Hoist up the john be
I feel so broke up I want to go home
Let me go home
The poor cook he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home
Why don't they let me go home
This is the worst trip I've ever been on
So hoist up the john be	's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home, let me go home
I want to go home, let me go home
Why don't you let me go home
