44. Tommy Roealbum
I went to a dance just the other night
I met a girl there she was out of sight
I asked a friend of mine who she could be
He said that her friends just call her Sweet Pea
[Chorus]
Oh Sweet Pea
Come on and dance with me
Come on come on come on and dance with me
Oh Sweet Pea
Come on and be my girl
Come on come on come on and be my girl
I walked on over and asked her to dance
Thinkin' maybe later of makin' romance
But every guy there was thinkin'; like me
I had to stand in line to get a dance with Sweet Pea
[Chorus: x2]
I finally got to whisper sweet words in her ear
Convinced that we ought a get away from there
We took a little walk I held her close to me
And underneath the stars I said to Sweet Pea
Oh Sweet Pea I love you can't you see
Love you love you love you can't you see
Oh Sweet Pea come on and be my girl
Come on come on come on and be my girl
