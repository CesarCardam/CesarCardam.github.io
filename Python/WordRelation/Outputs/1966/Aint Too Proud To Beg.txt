I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg, plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it
Please don't leave me girl (don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl (don't you go)
Now I've heard a cryin' man
Is half a man with no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you
I don't mind weepin' if it'll keep you by my side
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darling
Please don't leave me girl (don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl (don't you go)
If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walking away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'Cause I wanna keep you any way I can
Ain't too proud to beg and you know it
Please don't leave me girl (don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl (don't you go), ooh hoo
Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to call and plead to you, baby
If pleading keeps you from walking out that door
Ain't too proud to beg, you know it
Please don't leave me girl (don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl (don't you go)
Baby, sweet darling (please don't go)
