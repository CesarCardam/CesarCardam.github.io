I can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
I can't wait forever
To know if you'll be true
Time won't let me
Time won't let me
Time won't let me wait too long
Can't you see I've waited too long to love you
To hold you in my arms
Time won't let me
Time won't let me
Time won't let me aw
Oh
I can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
I can't wait forever
To know if you'll be true
Time won't let me
Time won't let me
Time won't let me wait that long
It won't let me wait that long
(Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait that long)
(Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait that long)
(Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait that long)
(Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait that long)
(Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait that long)
(Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait that long)
(Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait that long)
