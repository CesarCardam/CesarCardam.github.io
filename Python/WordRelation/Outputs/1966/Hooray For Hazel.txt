Hooray for Hazel, she put me down
Hooray for Hazel, she made me her clown
Hooray for Hazel, she's up to her tricks
Hooray for Hazel, she's getting her kicks
Hazel's been in love with many a guy
She tells them that she loves them and then says goodbye
Hooray for Hazel, I'm now on her list
I'm just another fool that couldn't resist
Hazel never feels any pity or shame
A broken heart is just a part of her evil game
Hooray for Hazel, she did it again
I'll join the ranks of broken hearts that she put me in
Hazel only does things she wants to do
She's selfish and spoiled and she knows that she's cute
Hooray for Hazel, she still gets her way
But there's a time a coming we'll be able to say
