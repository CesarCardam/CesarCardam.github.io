47. B.J. Thomas & The Triumphsalbum
Did you hear the lonesome whippoorwill?
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train
Is whining low
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see
A night so long
When time goes crawlin' by?
The moon just went
Behind a cloud
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see
A robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
That means he's lost
The will to live
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
The silence of
A fallin' star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
