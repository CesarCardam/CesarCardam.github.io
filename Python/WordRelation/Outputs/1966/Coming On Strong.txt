Coming on strong
Coming on strong
I can feel the heartaches
Coming on strong
I can feel the teardrops
The pain and sorrow
Ever since you've been gone
They've been coming on strong (coming on strong)
Coming on strong (Coming on strong)
Pain (pain), come on in (come on in)
Hello sorrow, I see you're back again (back again)
Teardrops (teardrops) glad you dropped by (you dropped by)
'Cause you can help drown my pride
And since you're here (da da da)
The time seems to fly (da da da)
To let you know that you're gonna be with me
'Til I lose my mind
But you've been gone (da da da)
Much too long (da da da)
And I can feel the heartaches
Coming on strong
Only thing you left me
Was misery for company
And memories of a love gone wrong
That keep coming on strong (coming on strong)
Coming on strong (coming on strong)
Coming on strong (coming on strong)
Coming on strong (coming on strong)
Pain (pain), I said to come on in (come on in)
Hello sorrow, I see you're back again (back again)
Teardrops (teardrops) glad you dropped by (you dropped by)
'Cause you can help drown my pride
And since you're here (da da da)
The time seems to fly (da da da)
To let you know that you're gonna be with me
'Til I lose my mind
But you've been gone (da da da)
Much too long (da da da)
And I can feel the heartaches
Coming on strong
Only thing you left me
Was misery for company
And memories of a love gone wrong
That keep coming on strong (coming on strong)
Coming on strong (coming on strong)
Coming on strong (coming on strong)
Coming on strong (coming on strong)
Coming on strong
