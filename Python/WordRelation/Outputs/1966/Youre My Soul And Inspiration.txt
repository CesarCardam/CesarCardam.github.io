03. Righteous BrothersThe Essential Collection
Girl, I can't let you do this
Let you walk away
Girl, how can I live through this
When you're all I wake up for each day?
Baby, you're my soul and my heart's inspiration
You're all I've got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby, what good am I?
I never had much goin'
But at least I had you
How can you walk out knowin'
I ain't got nothin' left if you do?
Baby, you're my soul and my heart's inspiration
You're all I've got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby, what good am I, oh what good am I?
Baby, I can't make it withoutcha.
And I'm, I'm tellin' ya, honey-you're my
reason for laughin', for cryin', for livin', and for dyin'.
Baby, I can't make it without you
Please, I'm begging you baby
If you go it will kill me
I swear it, Dear, my love can't bear it
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
You're all I've got to get me by
You're my soul and my heart's inspiration
Without you baby, what good am I, what good am I?
Mm-mm-mm Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
