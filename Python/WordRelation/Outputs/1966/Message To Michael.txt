77. Dionne WarwickSings Burt Bacharach
Spread your wings for New Orleans
Kentucky bluebird, fly away
And take a message to Michael, message to Michael
He sings each night in some cafe
In his search to find wealth and fame
I hear Michael has gone and changed his name
It's a year since he was here
Kentucky bluebird, fly away
And take a message to Michael, message to Michael
Tell him I miss him more each day
As his train pulled out down the track
Michael promised he'd soon be coming back
Oh tell him how my heart just breaks in two
Since he journeyed far
And even though his dreams of fame fell through
To me he will always be a star
Spread your wings for New Orleans
Kentucky bluebird, fly away
And take a message to Michael, message to Michael
Ask him to start for home today
When you find him please let him know
Rich or poor, I will always love him so
Fly away, Kentucky bluebird
Fly away, Kentucky bluebird
Fly away, fly away, fly away, fly away
