53. Johnny RiversBack at the Whisky
There's a man who leads a life of danger
To everyone he meets he stays a stranger
With every move he makes another chance he takes
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given you a number, I know they've take away your name
Beware of pretty faces that you find
A pretty face can hide an evil mind
Ah, be careful what you say
Or you'll give yourself away
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given you a number, I know they've take away your name
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given you a number, oh they've taken away your name
Swingin' on the Riviera one day
And then layin' in the Bombay alley next day
Oh, don't you let you let the wrong word slip
While kissing persuasive lips
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given you a number, oh they've take away your name
Secret agent man
