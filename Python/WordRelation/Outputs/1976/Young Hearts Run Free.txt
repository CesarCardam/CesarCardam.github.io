89. Candi Statonalbum
What's the sense in sharing, this one and only life
Ending up, just another lost and lonely wife
You count up the years, and they will be filled with tears
Love only breaks up, to start over again
You'll get the babies, but you won't have your man
While he is busy loving, every woman that he can ("aahh haa")
Say I'm gonna leave a thousand times a day
It's easier said that done
When I just can't break away ("just can't break away")
[CHORUS]
Young hearts, run free
Never be hung up, hung up like my man and me
("umm, my man and me")
Young hearts, to yourself be true
Don't be no fool
When love really don't love you (" don't love you")
It's high time just one crack at life
Who wants to live it in trouble and strife
My mind must be free, to learn all I can about me
I'm gonna love me, for the rest of my days
Encourage the babies every time they sing
Self preservation is what's, really going on today ("aahh, hooo")
Say I'm gonna turn lose a thousand times a day
But how can I turn loose
When I just can't break away ("just can't break away")
[CHORUS]
[music]
[CHORUS (fades out at the end)]
