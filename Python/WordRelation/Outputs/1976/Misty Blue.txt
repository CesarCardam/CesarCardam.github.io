19. Dorothy MooreMisty Blue
Oh, it's been such a long, long time,
Looks like I've kept you off my mind,
But I can't.
Just the thought of you,
Turns my whole world,
A misty blue.
Oh honey, just the mention of your name,
Turns the flicker to a flame,
Listen to me good baby, I think of things we used to do,
And my whole world,
Turns misty blue.
(chorus)
Oh-hh baby, I should forget you,
Heaven knows I tried,
Baby when I say that
"I'm glad we're through."
Deep in my heart I know I've lied.
I've lied
I've lied.
Oooo.
(end song repeating a version of verse 1)
