84. Jefferson Starshipalbum
Don't know what's happened to me since I met you
Feel like I'm fallen in love since I met you
I've got to know what you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin' babe it feels so good whatever it is
Knew from the start it had to be you
You got my heart, I don't know what I'm gonna do
With your love
Heaven sent the sign, then sent you
I'm goin' out of my mind since I let you
I've got to know what you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin' babe it feels so good whatever it is
Whatever it is and whatever it's called
I know that it's you, I can't help getting involved
With your love
Baby, sweet baby
Take it away
With your love
With your love
With your love
Whatever you did to me, well you sure did it good
My heart's filled with lovin' and I knew that it would
With your love
Don't know what's happened to me since I met you
I feel like I'm fallen in love since I met you
I've got to know what you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin', doin' to me with your love
With your love
What you're doin' babe it feels so good whatever it is
Knew from the start it had to be you
You got my heart I don't know what I'm gonna do
With your love
Baby sweet baby
