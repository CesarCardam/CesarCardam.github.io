80. Daryl Hall & John Oatesalbum
Everybody's high on consolation
Everybody's trying to tell me what's right for me
My daddy tried to bore me with a sermon
But it's plain to see that they can't comfort me
Sorry Charlie for the imposition
I think I've got it, got the strength to carry on
I need a drink and a quick decision
Now it's up to me, ooh what will be
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Better learn how to face it
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, what went wrong
Get up in the morning look in the mirror
I'm worn as her tooth brush hanging in the stand
My face ain't looking any younger
Now I can see love's taken her toll on me
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Better learn how to face it
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, what went wrong
Think I'll spend eternity in the city
Let the carbon and monoxide choke my thoughts away
And pretty bodies help dissolve the memories
But they can never be what she was to me
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Better learn how to face it
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, what went wrong
She's gone, oh I, oh I'd
Better learn how to face it
She's gone (she's gone)
I can't believe that she's gone, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone oh I, oh I'd
Better learn how to face it
She's gone (she's gone)
I can't believe that she's gone, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone (she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone)
She's gone (she's gone)
She's gone
