Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night
Gonna keep on dancin' to the
Rock and roll
On Saturday night, Saturday night
Dancin' to the rhythm in our
Heart and soul
On Saturday night, Saturday night
I-I-I just can't wait
I-I-I got a date
At the good ole rock and roll road
Show, I gotta go
Saturday night,
Saturday night
Gonna rock it up, roll it up
Do it all, have a ball,
Saturday night,
Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
Gonna dance with my baby till the
Night is through
On Saturday night, Saturday night
Tell her all the little things I'm
Gonna do
On Saturday night, Saturday night
I-I-I love her so
I-I-I I'm gonna let her know
At the good ole rock and roll road
Show, I gotta go
Saturday night,
Saturday night
Gonna rock it up, roll it up
Do it all, have a ball,
Saturday night,
Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
Saturday night, Saturday night
Saturday night, Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
Saturday night, Saturday night
Saturday night, Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
It's just a Saturday night
