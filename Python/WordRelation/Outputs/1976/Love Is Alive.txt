09. Gary Wrightalbum
Well I think it's time to get ready
To realize just what I have found
I have lived only half of what I am
It's all clear to me now
My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive, my love is alive, yeah, yeah, yeah
There's something inside
That's making me crazy
I'll try to keep it together
'Cause what I say may not happen the same way
Now could be forever
My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive, my love is alive, yeah, yeah, yeah
There's a mirror moving inside my mind
Reflecting the love that you shine on me
Hold on now to that feeling
Let it flow, let it grow, yeah, yeah
My heart is on fire
My soul's like a wheel that's turnin'
My love is alive, my love is alive, yeah, yeah, yeah
