Ooo and it's alright and it's comin' 'long
We got to get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We got to get right back to where we started from
Oh-ohhhhh
Do you remember that day
(That sunny day)
When you first came my way
I said no one could take your place
And if you get hurt
(If you get hurt)
By the little things I say
I can put that smile back on your face
Ooo and it's alright and it's comin' 'long
We got to get right back to where we started from
Love is good, love can be strong
We got to get right back to where we started from
A love like ours
(A love like ours)
Can never fade away
You know it's only just begun
You give me your love
(Give me your love)
I just can't stay away
I know that you're the only one
