15. Diana RossLife &amp; Love: The Very Best Of Diana Ross
Ah
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
Don't want it
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't want it
Think about it all the time
Thinking on it makes me smile
And say hey
I don't want to shake it
Lovin' love you makin'
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
I don't want it
If there's a remedy
I'll run from it
From it
Think about it all the time
Never let it out of my mind
'Cause I love you
I've got the sweetest hangover
I don't wanna get over
Sweetest hangover
Yeah, I don't wanna get over
Sweet love
Sweet love
I don't want to get over this
I don't want to get over this (ha)
I don't want to get over this
I don't want to get over this (ha)
I don't want to get over this
I don't want to get over
I don't want to get over this
I've got the sweetest hangover
Sweetest hangover, yeah
I don't want to get over
I don't want to get
I don't want to get
Over
Ooh, I don't need no cure
I don't need no cure
I don't need no cure
Sweet lovin'
Sweet, sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love
Don't call a doctor
Don't call her momma
Don't call her preacher
No, I don't need it
I don't need it (Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet love)
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
Don't want it
