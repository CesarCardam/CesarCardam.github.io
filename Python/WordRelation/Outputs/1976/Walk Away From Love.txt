87. David Ruffinalbum
It's not that I don't love you,you know how much I do. And it's not that I've found someone to take the place of you.It's just a fear that builds within me everytime you touch my hand.And a dread that shakes my body,that even I don't understand,so I'm leaving.This time I'm playing it smart.I'm gonna walk away from love before love breaks my heart.
Oh you're clenging to me tighter than you ever have before.I don't understand it.But I know it's gonna take everything I've got to keep walking out the door.But those arms you've got around me will let me go someday.And I'd rather leave you holding on,than pushing me away,so I'm leaving yes I am.This time I'm playing it smart.I'm gonna walk away from love before love breaks my heart.
