Woo!
Slowride, take it easy [Repeat x3]
I'm in the mood
The rhythm is right
Move to the music
We can roll all night
Oooh Slowride
Oooh
Slowride, take it easy [Repeat]
Slow down, go down, got to get your lovin' one more time
Hold me, roll me, slow ridin' woman you're so fine
Woo!
I'm in the mood
The rhythm is right
Move to the music
We can roll all night
Oooh
Slowride, take it easy
Slow down, go down, got to get your lovin' one more time
Slowride, easy, slowride, sleazy
Slow down, go down, got to get your lovin' one more time
Hold me, roll me, slow ridin' woman you're so fine
Slowride, take it easy
Slow down, go down, slow down, go down
Come on baby
Take a slowride on me
Come on baby
Take a slowride
Feels so good, Feels good, Come on baby
Feels good, Feel allright
[Repeat x2]
You know the rhythm is right
We gotta rock all night
Whoa, rock all night
Woo! Woo!
Your flamin' heart [Repeat x3]
Woo! Woo! Woo!
Slowride
