88. Peter FramptonFrampton Comes Alive
Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city but don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait hey
Ooh baby I love your way every day
want to tell you I love your way every day
want to be with you night and day
Moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power shine shine shine
I can see them under the pines
But don't hesitate 'cause your love won't wait hey
Ooh baby I love your way every day
want to tell you I love your way every day
want to be with you night and day uh yeah
But don't hesitate 'cause your love won't wait
I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and grey and blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
Wish I could dry one out of season
But don't hesitate 'cause your love won't wait hey
Ooh baby I love your way every day
want to tell you I love your way uuhh
want to be with you night and day
Ooh baby I love your way every day
want to tell you I love your way uuhh
want to be with you night and day
