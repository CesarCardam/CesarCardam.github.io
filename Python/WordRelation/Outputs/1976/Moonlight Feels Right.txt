34. Starbuckalbum
The wind blew some luck in my direction
I caught it in my hands today
I finally made a tricky frech connection
You winked and gave me your ok
I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothing like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way, ha, ha
Moonlight feels right, moonlight feels right
We'll lay back and observe the constellations
And watch the moon smiling bright
I'll play the radio on southern stations
'Cause southern belles are hell at night
You say you came to Baltimore from Ole Miss
A class of '74 gold ring
The eastern moon looks ready for a wet kiss
To make the tide rise again, ha, ha
Moonlight feels right, moonlight feels right
We'll see the sun come up on sunday mornin'
And watch it fade the moon away
I guess you know I'm givin' you a warnin'
'Cause me and moon are itchin' to play
I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothing like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way
Moonlight feels right, moonlight feels right
