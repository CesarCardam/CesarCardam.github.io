81. Beach Boysalbum
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat
You can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be
Rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me.
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast.
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that
Rock and roll music
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear man awail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man
They were goin' like a hurrican'
That's why I go for that
Rock and roll music
'way down south they grave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' homebrew from a water cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up
And started playin' that
Rock and roll music
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to hear a mambo
It's 'way too early for a congo
So keep a-rockin' that piano
So I can hear some of that
Rock and roll music
