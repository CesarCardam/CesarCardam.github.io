94. Barry Manilowalbum
Doctor my woman is comin' back home late today
Could ya' maybe give me something?
'Cause the feelin' is gone
And I must get it back right away
Before she sees that I've been
Up, down, tryin' to get the feelin' again
All around tryin' to get the feelin' again
The one that made me shiver
Made my knees start to quiver
Every time she walked in
And I've looked high, low,
Everywhere I possibly can
But there's no tryin' to get the feelin' again
It seemed to disappear as fast as it came
Where did it run to?
I thought I'd done all that I could
Just to keep the love light burnin'
But whatever I've done I guess
I just haven't done it too good
'Cause all that's left is yearnin'
I've been up, down, tryin' to get the feelin' again
All around tryin' to get the feelin' again
The one that made me shiver
Made my knees start to quiver
Every time she walked in
And I've looked high, and low
And everywhere I possibly can
But there's no tryin' to get the feelin' again
It seemed to disappear as fast as it came
I've been looking, I've been looking, I've been looking
I've been up, and down and tryin' to get the feelin'
I've been up, I've been down, I've been tryin' to get
I've been tryin', I've been tryin',I've been tryin'
To get the feeling
I've been tryin' to get the feeling again
I want to get that feeling
I'm going to get that feeling
I got to get that feeling
I got to get that feeling
And again, and again, and again, and again
Tryin' to get that feeling
I been tryin' to get the feeling again
