You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs
I look around me and I see it isn't so
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
And what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know
'Cause here I go again
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
I can't explain the feeling's plain to me; can't you see?
Ah, she gave me more, she gave it all to me now can't you see?
What's wrong with that?
I need to know
'Cause here I go again
I love you, I love you
Love doesn't come in a minute
Sometimes it doesn't come at all
I only know that when I'm in it
It isn't silly, love isn't silly, love isn't silly at all
How can I tell you about my loved one?
How can I tell you about my loved one?
"I love you" over Paul's "How can I tell you about my loved one?"
"I love you" over Paul's "How can I tell you about my loved one?"
I love you
I love you
"I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, say can't you see?"
"I love you"
"Ah, he gave me all, he gave it all to me to me, say can't you see?"
"I love you"
"I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, say can't you see?"
"How can I tell you about my loved one?"
"Ah, he gave me all, he gave it all to me to me say can't you see?"
"How can I tell you about my loved one?"
"I can't explain the feeling's plain to me, say can't you see?"
"How can I tell you about my loved one?"
"Ah, he gave me all, he gave it all to me to me say can't you see?"
"How can I tell you about my loved one?"
You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs
I look around me and I see it isn't so, oh no
Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
What's wrong with that?
