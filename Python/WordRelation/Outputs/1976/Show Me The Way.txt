50. Peter FramptonFrampton Comes Alive
I wonder how you're feeling
There's ringing in my ears
And no one to relate to except the sea
Who can I believe in?
I'm kneeling on the floor
There has to be a force
Who do I phone?
The stars are out and shining
But all I really want to know
Oh won't you show me the way
I want you show me the way
Well, I can see no reason,
You living on your nerves
When someone drops a cup and I submerge
I'm swimming in a circle,
I feel I'm going down
There has to be a fool
To play my part
Someone thought of healing,
But all I really want to know
Oh won't you show me the way
I want you show me the way
I want you day after day
I wonder if I'm dreaming
I feel so unashamed
I can't believe this is happening to me
I watch you when you're sleeping
And then I want to take your love
Oh won't you show me the way
Oh won't you show me the way
I want you day after day
I want you day after day
Oh won't you show me the way
I want you day after day
