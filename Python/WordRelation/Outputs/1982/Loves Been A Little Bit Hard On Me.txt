I've got nothing to be ashamed of
Love's been a little bit hard on me
If I shy away it's only because
Love's been a little bit hard on me
(Love's been a little)
Oh, love's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
You know just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
Now, I can remember when it's been so much
Love's been a little bit hard on me
Now I shy away at the slightest touch
Love's been a little bit hard on me
(Love's been a little)
Oh, you know it's been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
(Love's been a little)
Just a little, little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
Come out, come out
To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light
Come out, come out
To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light
I'll be back when I calm my fears
Love's been a little bit hard on me
And I'll see you around in a thousand years
Love's been a little bit hard on me
(Love's been a little)
You know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
Oh, love you know it's just been a little
(Love's been a little bit hard on me)
