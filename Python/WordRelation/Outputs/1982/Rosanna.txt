All I want to do when I wake up in the morning is see you eyes
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that a girl like you could ever care for me, Rosanna
All I want to do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know you were looking for more than I could ever be
Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna
Now she's gone and I have to say
(Chorus:)
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna
I can see your face still shining through the window on the other side
Rosanna, Rosanna
I didn't know that a girl like you could make me feel so sad, Rosanna
All I want to tell you is now you'll never ever have to compromise
Rosanna, Rosanna
I never thought that losing you could ever hurt so bad
Not quite a year since she went away, Rosanna
Now she's gone and I have to say
(Repeat chorus)
(Instrumental break)
Not quite a year since she went away,
Who is it? Rosanna
Now she's gone and I have to say
(Repeat chorus)
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna
Meet you all the way, meet you all the way, Rosanna
