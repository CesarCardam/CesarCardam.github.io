That girl thinks that she's so fine
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart
She thinks in no time flat
That she'll be free and clear to start
With her emotional rescued love
That you'll leave torn apart
That girl thinks that she's so bad
She'll change my tears to joy from sad
She says she keeps the upper hand
'Cause she can please her man
She doesn't use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong
And inside me there's no room for doubt
That it won't be too long
Before I tell her
That I love her, that I want her
That my mind, soul and body need her
Tell her that I'd love to
That I want to
That I need to do
All that I have to, to win her love
I've been hurting for a long time
And you've been playing for a long time
You know it's true
I've been holding for a long time
And you've been running for a long time
It's time to do what we have to do
That girl
That girl yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand
But she says her love is much too deep
For them to understand
She says her love has been crying out
But her lover hasn't heard
But what she doesn't realize is that
I've listened to every word
That's why I know I'll tell her
That I love her, that I want her
That my mind, soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to
That I want to
That I need to do
All that I have to, to win her love
Tell her I love her, that I want her
That my mind, soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to
That I want to
That I need to do
All that I have to, to win her love
Tell I love her, that I want her
That my mind, soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to
That I want to
That I need to do
All that I have to, to win her love
That I love her, that I want her
That my mind, soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to
That I want to
That I need to do
All that I have to, to win her love
That girl, that girl, that girl
Oh, that girl, that girl, that girl
