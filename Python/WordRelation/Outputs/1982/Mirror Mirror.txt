86. Diana RossLife &amp; Love: The Very Best Of Diana Ross
Mirror, mirror on the wall
You said you had the answer to it all
You never told me I'd take a fall
Mirror, mirror on the wall
You have turned my life
Into a paperback novel
Words that came to life
Inside your little melodrama
Chapter one: When I was young,
I came to you with my problems
Chapter two: You promised me
Love and anything that I desired
Tell me mirror, mirror,
Mirror on the wall
Thought you said
You had the answer to it all
Never told me
I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror,
Mirror on the wall
You have nailed my heart
Upon the wall for your pleasure
You have cast a spell
That cannot ever be broken
and now my eyes grow tired
I watch my picture getting older
But I remain the same
Trapped in this mirror forever.
Tell me mirror, mirror,
Mirror on the wall
Thought you said
You had the answer to it all
Never told me
I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror,
Mirror on the wall
I talk to you each night
and I follow your advice
You've been wrong
What's the price I have to pay
For this fairy tale thing called love
Let me go
Tell me mirror, mirror,
Mirror on the wall
Thought you said
You had the answer to it all
Never told me
I was gonna take a fall
Tell me mirror, mirror,
Mirror on the wall
