52. Paul Davisalbum
I sometimes wonder why
All the flowers have to die
I dream about you
And now, Summer's come and gone
And the nights they seem so long
Come on over tonight
Come on over
It's gonna be a cool night
Just let me hold you by the firelight
If it don't feel right you can go
Oh, when the cool night brings back memories
Of a good life when this love was not so old
Oh, I won't talk about the past
How love's supposed to last forever
And you, don't have to take a stand
Lay out any plans
Come on over tonight
Come on over
