04. Paul McCartney & Stevie WonderTripping the Live Fantastic
Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we?
We all know that people are the same where ever you go
There is good and bad in ev'ryone
We learn to live, we learn to give
Each other what we need to survive together alive
Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord why don't we?
Ebony, ivory living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory, ooh
We all know that people are the same where ever you go
There is good and bad in ev'ryone
We learn to live, when we learn to give
Each other what we need to survive together alive
Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord why don't we?
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we
Ebony, ivory living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory living in perfect harmony
Ebony, ivory living in perfect harmony
