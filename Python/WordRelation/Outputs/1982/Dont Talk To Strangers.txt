20. Rick SpringfieldLive and Kickin&#039;
When you were just a young girl and still in school
How come you never learned the golden rule
Don't talk to strange men, don't be a fool
I'm hearing stories, I don't think that's cool
Why don't you tell me, someone is loving you
'Cause you're my girl, some say it's no longer true
You're seeing some slick continental dude
I'm begging you, please
Don't talk to strangers, baby don't you talk
Don't talk to strangers, you know he'll only use you up
Don't talk, don't talk, don't talk,
Don't talk, don't talk to him
Nobody, talk, nobody, ever told you, don't talk
Now tell me, how's life in the big city
I hear the competition's tough, baby that's a pity
And every man's an actor, every girl is pretty
I don't like what's getting back to me
Now who's this, don juan I've been hearing of
Love hurts when only one's in love
Did you fall at first sight or did you need a shove
I'm begging you, please
Don't talk to strangers, baby don't you talk
Don't talk to strangers, you know he'll only use you up
Don't talk, don't talk, don't talk,
Don't talk, don't talk to him
Nobody, talk, nobody ever told you, don't talk
Fais l'amour avec moi
What's he saying baby
Viens dormir, mon amour (come to sleep my love)
I asked you not to talk to him
Je t'aime donne moi ton coeur ce soir (I like you to give me your heart this night)
I'm begging you
Don't talk to strangers, baby don't you talk
Don't talk to strangers, you know he'll only use you up
Don't talk, don't talk, don't talk,
Don't talk, don't talk to him
Nobody, talk, nobody ever told you, don't talk
Don't talk to strangers, baby don't you talk
Don't talk to strangers, you know he'll only use you up
Don't talk to strangers, baby don't you,
Baby don't you talk,
Don't talk to strangers
