Want to see you with it
Sure could treat you right
Give me just a minute
Of your time tonight
We both are here to have the fun
So let it whip
We'll get into grooving
Love your body language
Baby, let me know
You've got me sort of anxious
We both are here to have the fun
So let it whip
So let it whip,let's whip it baby
Child, let's whip it right
Get a grip, let's whip it baby, work it all night
Well what's your trip, child
Come on let it whip
Now that you can see
How you groove with me
What else can I do
To get closer to you
We both are here to have the fun
So let it whip
We have the natural feeling
Obviously revealing
Let me be your paper man
I'd love to be your joker man
We both are here to have the fun
So let it whip
So let it whip,let's whip it baby
Child, let's whip it right
Get a grip, let's whip it baby, work it all night
Well what's your trip, child
Come on let it whip
So let it whip,let's whip it baby
Child, let's whip it right
Get a grip, let's whip it baby, work it all night
Well what's your trip, child
Come on let it whip
There's no time to lose
You're the one I choose, you're so right
You're the one I choose,
I only want to be with you
You're the one for me
Can't you see that I
I won't waste your time
I sense something divine in you
yes I do
So let it whip,let's whip it baby
Child, let's whip it right
Get a grip, let's whip it baby, work it all night
Well what's your trip, child
Come on let it whip
let's whip it baby
let's whip it right
let's whip it baby, whip it all night
Come on whip [Repeat: x2]
There's no time to lose
You're the one I choose, it's alright
You're the one I choose,
I only want to be with you
You're the one for me
Can't you see that I
I won't waste your time
I sense something divine in you
yes I do
So let it whip,let's whip it baby
Child, let's whip it right
Get a grip, let's whip it baby, work it all night
Well what's your trip, child
Come on let it whip
So let it whip,let's whip it baby
Child, let's whip it right
Get a grip, let's whip it baby, work it all night
Well what's your trip, child
Come on let it whip
