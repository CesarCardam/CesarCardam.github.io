40. AsiaAsia
When I ride the hounds of hell
Twist my foot, I nearly fell
I was lucky I was alive
One look back, I could have died
I was the sole survivor
Sole survivor, sole survivor
Solitary fire
When I saw it I was amazed
One time glory right in my gaze
I saw sorrow, I saw the joy
Light in the darkness none could destroy
I am the sole survivor
Sole survivor, sole survivor
Solitary fire
And from the wreckage I will arise
Cast the ashes back in their eyes
See the fire I will defend
Just keep on burning right to the end
I'll be the sole survivor
Sole survivor
