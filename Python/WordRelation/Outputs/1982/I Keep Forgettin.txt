I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin' it all
Every time you're near
Every time I see your smile
Hear your hello
Saying you can only stay a while
Hey, I know that it's hard for you
To say the things
We both know are true
But tell me how come
I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin', babe
Every time I hear
How you never want to live a lie
How it's gone too far
And you don't have to tell me why
Why you're gone and why the game is through
If this is what's real
If this is what's true
Tell me how come
I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin'
Don't say that, don't say that, don't say that
I know you're not mine anymore, anyway, anytime
Tell me how come
I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin', baby
I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin'
