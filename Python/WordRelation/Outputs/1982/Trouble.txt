45. Lindsey Buckinghamalbum
Two, ah-three, ah-four!
Two, ah-three, ah-four!
Two, ah-three, ah-four!
I really should be saying goodnight.
I really shouldn't stay anymore.
It's been so long since I held ya.
I've forgotten what love is for.
I should run on the double
I think I'm in trouble,
I think I'm in trouble.
So come to me darlin' and hold me
Let your honey keep you warm
Been so long since I held ya
I've forgotten what love is for.
