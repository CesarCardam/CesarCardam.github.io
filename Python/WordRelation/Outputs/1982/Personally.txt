60. Karla BonoffWild Heart of the Young
I've been writing letters every day now
Since you've been gone
Talking to you by telephone
For what seems like a whole life long
But I've got something to give you
That the mailman can't deliver
I can't mail it in
I can't phone it in
I can't send it in
Even by your closest kin
The thing that I'm speaking of
Is a whole lot of love
A whole mess of love
I'm bringing it to you personally
I'm bringing it to you personally
