Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around?
Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around?
Lonely driver
Out on the road
With a hundred miles to go
Sole survivor
Carrying the load
Switches on his radio
Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down (down down)
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around?
Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down (down down)
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around?
In the audience
Watching the show
With a paper in his hand
(In his hand, in his hand)
Some important impresario
Has a message for the band
Oh
Take it away
Want to hear you play
Till the lights go down (down down)
Take it away
Don't you want to stay
Till there's no one else around?
You never know who may be
Listening to you
Never know who may be
Listening to you
You never know who may be
Listening to you
Take it away, take it away
After hours
Late in the bar
By a darkened corner seat
Faded flowers wait in the jar
Till the evening is complete
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
