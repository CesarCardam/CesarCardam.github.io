46. Roberta Flackalbum
Here close to our feelings we touch again
We love again
Remember when we thought
Our hearts would never mend
And we're all the better for each other
There's more to love, I know
Than making love
Here no more confusion, we see our lives
We live our lives
Remember when we thought
We never would survive
But now neither one of us is breaking
There's more to love, I know
Than making love
Some things never change
Some things sometimes do
And now I'm feeling strong enough to let you in
And now neither one of us is breaking
Now we know there's more to love
Than making love
And I'll remember you and making love
And I'll remember you
And I'll remember you
And I'll remember you
And I'll remember you
