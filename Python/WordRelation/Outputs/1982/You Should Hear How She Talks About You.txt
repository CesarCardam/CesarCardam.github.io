You Should Hear How She Talks About You
Melissa Manchester
Tom Snow/Dean Pitchford
She's so very nice you should break the ice
Let her know that she's on your mind
Whatcha tryin' to hide when you know inside
She's the best thing you'll ever find?
Ahh, can't you see it?
Don't you think she's feeling the same?
Ahh, I guarantee it,
She's the one that's calling your name
CHORUS:
You should hear how she talks about you,
You should hear what she says
She says she would be lost without you,
She's half out of her head (out of her head)
You should hear how she talks about you,
She just can't get enough.
She says she would be lost without you,
She is really in love.
(spoken) She's in love with you boy
I ain't tellin' tales, anybody else
Could repeat the things that I've heard
She's been talkin' sweet and it's on the street
How our girlfriend's spreadin' the word
Ahh, you should hurry,
You should let her know how you feel
Ahh, now don't you worry
If you're scared this love is for real
You should hear how she talks about you,
You should hear what she says
She says she would be lost without you,
She's half out of her head (out of her head)
You should hear how she talks about you,
She is really in love
(She is really in love)
Ahh, you should hurry
You should let her know how you feel
Ahh, now don't you worry
If you're scared this love is for real
CHORUS
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Can'tcha see? (Can'tcha see?)
It's me!
CHORUS
