I want you to want me
I'm goin' crazy knowin' he will be your lover tonight
And when he comes I'll let you go
I'll just pretend as you walk out the door
Oh no, I can't sleep
Oh no, I'm goin' crazy with love over you
I need you to need me
I wanna hold you but you're holdin' someone else in your arms
When I close my eyes I see your face
I'm just not sure how much my heart can erase
Oh no, I can't think
Oh no, I'm goin' crazy with love over you
Oh, honey
Oh, sugar
Oh no, I can't sleep anymore, baby
Oh no, I can't think anymore, baby
Oh no, I'm goin' crazy with love over you
