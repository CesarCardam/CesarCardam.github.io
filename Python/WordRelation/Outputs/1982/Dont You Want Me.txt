You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar, when I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up
And turned you around, turned you into someone new
Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back there too
