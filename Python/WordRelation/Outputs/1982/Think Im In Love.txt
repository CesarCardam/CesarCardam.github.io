Oh, something's got a hold of me now
It's a feeling, burnin' up like I'm on fire
Hold me tight babe, don't leave me by myself tonight
'Cause I don't think I can make it through the night
I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love
It surrounds me, ooh, like a sea of madness
It controls me, makes me do all the things I do for you
On my mind babe, thinkin' about you now
And I don't know if I'll make it through the night
I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love
I think I'm in love and love's enough
I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love
Baby help me do it
There must be something to it
I know it's gotta be love
