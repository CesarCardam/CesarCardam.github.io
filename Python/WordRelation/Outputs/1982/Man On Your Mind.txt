92. Little River Bandalbum
Little River Band
I can feel it floating away
Inch by inch, day by day
Love boat set itself free
Castaway, slipping out to sea
I can feel it coming adrift
Even a blind man could see the rift
From an ocean liner to a Chinese Junk
There ain't been a ship that can't be sunk
I used to dream it could last forever
But pipedreams never come true
I'd be foolin' myself if I never
Thought something like this
Couldn't happen to you
I said baby you've got a man on your mind
You got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say goodbye
You don't know just what you got till it's gone
I guess you heard that a lot but it's true
It's not just a game
You can't change your life
By changing your name
It's not something you can hide away
Sooner or later it starts to show
It's written on your face
You've been betrayed
Do you really believe that I don't know
I said baby you've got a man on your mind
You got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say goodbye
It's already fallen
So it's no use to fight
And if he starts callin'
Let him know you're with me
For the rest of the night
Ooh I said baby you've got a man on your mind
You got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say goodbye
Baby you've got a man on your mind
You got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say goodbye
