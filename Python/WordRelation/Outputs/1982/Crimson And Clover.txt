78. Joan Jett & The BlackheartsI Love Rock &#039;N Roll
Ah, now I don't hardly know her
But I think I can love her
Crimson and clover
Ah, now when she comes walkin' over
Now I've been waitin' to show her
Crimson and clover, over and over
Yeah, I'm not such a sweet thing
I wanna do everything
What a beautiful feelin'
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
