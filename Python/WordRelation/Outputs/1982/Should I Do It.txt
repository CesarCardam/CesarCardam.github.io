I swore when he hurt me so
I wouldn't see him anymore
But today he called my name
Oh, I could feel the same old flame
Should I do it, should I fall?
Should I do it after all oh?
Is it crazy, is it right?
I really want to love him tonight
Should I do it, should I play?
Can I help it anyway?
When I feel him hold me tight
I'm gonna turn on like a light
I know when we're in his car
I couldn't go just so far
I want to give him everything
So, when I hear the telephone ring, yeah
Should I do it, should I fall?
Should I do it after all oh?
Is it crazy, is it right?
I really want to love him tonight
Should I do it, should I play?
Can I help it anyway?
When I feel him hold me tight
I'm gonna turn on like a light
Oh, I'm so lonely and he's so fine
Maybe I should swallow my pride
Just one, one, one more time, yeah
Baby, I've got to know
Should I do it, should I fall?
Should I do it after all oh?
Is it crazy, is it right?
I really want to love him tonight
Should I do it, should I play?
Can I help it anyway?
When I feel him hold me tight
I'm gonna turn on like a light
Should I do it, should I do it (should i do it?)
Should I do it, should I do it (oh, should i do it?)
Should I do it, should I do it (should've, i should've walked away)
Should I do it, should I do it (it's driving me crazy)
Should I do it, should I do it (should i do it?)
Should I do it, should I do it (lookin', lookin' so good)
Should I do it, should I do it (i didn't want to love him)
Should I do it, should I do it (i don't know)
Should I do it, should I do it (i just dont know)
Should I do it, should I do it (i really wanna love him)
Should I do it, should I do it (drivin' me crazy)
Should I do it, should I do it (yea, he's drivin' me crazy)
Should I do it, should I do it (i just dont know)
