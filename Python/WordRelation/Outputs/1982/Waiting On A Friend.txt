94. Rolling StonesGRRR! [5 CD Super Deluxe]
Watching girls go passing by it ain't the latest thing
I'm just standing in a doorway.
I'm just trying to make some sense.
Out of these girls passing by, the tales they tell of men.
I'm not waiting on a lady, I'm just waiting on a friend. Mm.
A smile relieves a heart that grieves, remember what I said.
I'm not waiting on a lady, I'm just waiting on a friend.
I'm just waiting on a friend, just waiting on a friend.
I'm just waiting on a friend, I'm just waiting on a friend,
just waiting on a friend.
Don't need a whore, don't need no booze, don't need a virgin priest.
But I need some one I can cry to.
I need someone to protect.
Ooh, making love and breaking hearts, it is a game for youth.
But I'm not waiting on a lady.
I'm just waiting on a friend.
I'm just waiting on a friend, just waiting on a friend.
I'm just waiting on a friend, just waiting on a friend.
