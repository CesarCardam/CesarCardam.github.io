51. Huey Lewis & The NewsPicture This
I was walking down a one way street
Just a looking for someone to meet
One woman who was looking for a man
Now I'm hoping that the feeling is right
And I'm wondering if you'll stay for the night
So I'm coming (i don't want to be lonely)
I want to love you all over
[Chorus]
Do you believe in love
Do you believe it' true
Do you believe in love
Oh you can bet I believe it too
Now the feeling is beginning to grow
And the meaning is something you only know
If you believe it take my hand and I'll take your heart
Now I'm wondering where does true love begin
I'm going under so I'm lettin' you in
My woman (i don't want to be lonely)
I want to love you all over
[Chorus]
I use to have you in a photograph
(I'm so glad it's changed)
But now I've got you and it's gonna last
(Do you believe in love)
[Chorus]
