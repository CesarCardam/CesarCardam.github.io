81. Doris Troyalbum
Just one look and I fell so hard
In love with you uh oh uh oh
I found out how good it feels
To have your love uh oh uh oh
Say you will, will be mine
Forever and always uh oh uh oh
Just one look and I knew
That you were my only one uh oh uh oh
I thought I was dreaming but I was wrong
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh but ah I'm gonna keep on scheming
'Til I can ah make you, make you my own
So you see I really care
Without you I'm nothing uh oh uh oh
Just one look and I know
I'll get you someday uh oh uh oh
Just one look, that's all it took
