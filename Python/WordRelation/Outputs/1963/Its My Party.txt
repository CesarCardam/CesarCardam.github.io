29. Lesley GoreThe Golden Hits of Lesley Gore
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
Playin' my records, keep dancin' all night
But leave me alone for a while
Till Johnny's dancin' with me
I've got no reason to smile
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
Judy and Johnny just walked through the door
Like a queen with her king
Oh what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearin' his ring
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
Oh it's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
