87. Nat King Colealbum
If I had to choose just one day
If I had to choose just one day
To last my whole life through
It would surely be that Sunday
The day that I met you
Newborn whippoorwills were calling from the hills
Summer was a-coming in but fast
Lots of daffodils were showing off their skills
Nodding all together, I could almost hear them whisper
"Go on, kiss her, go on and kiss her"
And if I had to choose one moment
To live within my heart
It would be that tender moment
Recalling how we started
Darling, it would be when you smiled at me
That way, that Sunday, that summer
Newborn whippoorwills were calling from the hills
Summer was a-comin' in but fast
Lots of daffodils were showin' off their skills
Nodding all together, I could almost hear them whisper
"Go on, kiss her, go on and kiss her"
If I had to choose one moment
To live within my heart
It would be that tender moment
Recalling how we started
Darling, it would be when you smiled at me
That way, that Sunday, that summer
If I had to choose just one day
