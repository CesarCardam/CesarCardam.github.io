73. Rufus ThomasStax Profiles
Baby's back, dressed in black,
Silver buttons all down her back.
High, low, tipsy toe,
She broke a needle and she can't sew.
Walkin' the dog,
Just walkin' the dog.
If you don't know how to do it,
I'll show you how to walk te dog.
Asked a fellow for fifteen cents,
See the fellow he jumped the fence.
Jumped so high he touched the sky,
Never got back till the fourth of July.
Walkin' the dog,
Just walkin' the dog.
If you don't know how to do it,
I'll show you how to walk the dog.
