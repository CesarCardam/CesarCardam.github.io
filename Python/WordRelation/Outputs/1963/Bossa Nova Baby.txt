95. Elvis Presley2nd to None
I said, take it easy, baby
I worked all day
And my feet feel just like lead
You got my shirt tails
Flyin' all over the place
And the sweat poppin' out of my head
She said, hey, bossa nova baby
Keep on a workin' for
This ain't no time to quit
She said, go, bossa nova baby
Keep on dancin'
I'm about to have myself a fit
Bossa nova, bossa nova
I said, hey, little mama
Let's sit down
Have a drink and dig the band
She said, drink, drink, drink
Oh, fiddle de dink
I can dance with a drink in my hand
She said, hey, bossa nova baby
Keep on workin' for
This ain't no time to drink
She said, go, bossa nova baby
Keep on dancin'
'Cause I ain't got time to think
Bossa nova, bossa nova
I said, come on, baby
It's hot in here
And it's oh so cool outside
If you lend me a dollar
I can buy some gas
And we can go for a little ride
She said, hey bossa nova baby
Keep on workin' for
I ain't got time for that
She said, go, bossa nova baby
Keep on dancin'
Or I'll find myself another cat
Bossa nova, bossa nova
Bossa nova, bossa nova
Bossa nova, bossa nova
