Here she comes
Little town flirt
You're falling for her
And you're gonna get hurt
Yeah, I know it's so hard to resist
The temptation of her tender red lips
But you can hurt, hurt
Yeah, you can get hurt
Foolin' around
With that little town flirt
Here she comes
With that look in her eye
She plays around
With every guy that goes by
Yeah, I know she's gonna treat you wrong
So your heart just better be strong
'Cause you can hurt, hurt
Yeah, you can get hurt
Foolin' around
With that little town flirt
I know how you feel
You think her love is real
You think this time she'll be since
But you think you've got a paper heart
When she starts to tear it apart
That's when she'll let you go, whoa, whoa, whoa
Here she comes
Just look at that style
She's looking at you
Giving you that smile
Yeah, I know she's gonna treat you wrong
So your heart just better be strong
'Cause you can hurt, hurt
Yeah, you can get hurt
Foolin' around
With that little town flirt
You better run and hide now boy
You better pass her by, now, yeah, boy
You better run and hide now, yeah, boy
You better pass her by
