My boyfriend's back and you're gonna be in trouble.
(Hey, la-di-la, my boyfriend's back.)
When you see him comin', better cut on the double.
(Hey, la-di-la, my boyfriend's back.)
You've been spreading lies that I was untrue.
(Hey, la-di-la, my boyfriend's back.)
So look out now 'cause he's comin' after you.
(Hey, la-di-la, my boyfriend's back.)
And he knows that you've been tryin',
And he knows that you've been lyin'.
He's been gone for such a long time.
(Hey, la-di-la, my boyfriend's back.)
Now he's back and things will be fine.
(Hey, la-di-la, my boyfriend's back.)
You're gonna be sorry you were ever born.
(Hey, la-di-la, my boyfriend's back.)
'Cause he's kinda big and he's awful strong.
(Hey, la-di-la, my boyfriend's back.)
And he knows about your cheatin',
Now you're gonna get a beatin'.
What made you think he'd believe all your lies?
(Ah-oo, ah-oo.)
You're a big man now, but he'll cut you down to size!
(Ah-oo.)
Wait and see!
My boyfriend's back, he's gonna save my reputation
