71. Jackie Wilsonalbum
Hey, you
Come out here on the floor
Let's rock some more
Come out here on the floor
Honey, let's rock some more, yeah
Now when you get out here
Don't you have no fear
Put your hands on your hip
And let your backbone slip
And work out
Oh, my momma, move up (first step)
Party move back (second step)
Shuffle to the left (third step)
Wobble to the right (fourth step)
Now it's plain to see
You put a hurtin' on me
But it's a natural fact
Ha, I like it like that
So work out
Yeah, baby work out (work baby, work out)
Honey, work out
Ah, baby work out
Shout and turn the joint out
Work out (work out)
Work out (work out)
Work all night long
Yeah, yeah ('round and around and around and around)
('Round and around and around and around)
('Round and around and around and around)
('Round and around and around and around)
('Round)
Ah, baby, round and round we go
Don't you know, don't you know?
'Round and 'round we go
Where we stop, nobody knows
Yeah, the band is swinging on the stand
We're moving in, we're moving out
Then we'll step back now and end this dance with a shout
So work out
Now when I tell you to shout I want you to jump at it
Yeah, baby let's shout (shout baby shout, shout)
Honey, let's shout (shout baby shout, shout)
Ah baby, let's shout (shout baby shout, shout)
Yeah, shout and turn it out, baby
Hey, let's shout, let's shout, shout all night long
I gotta have it just one more time
Now here we go
Round and round we go
Ah baby
Round and round we go
Now work out, work out, work all night long, ah
Work, work out, baby
Ah, work out woman
Shout and turn the joint out
Work out, work out, baby, baby
