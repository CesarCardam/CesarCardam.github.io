71. Marvin GayeCollected
You are my pride and joy
And I just love you, little darlin'
Like a baby boy loves his toy
You've got kisses sweeter than honey
And I work every day to give you all I know
And that's why you're my pride and joy
And I'm tellin' the world
You're my pride and joy
I believe I'm no baby boy
But I know you're mine
My pride and joy
Yeah baby, yeah baby
You, you are my pride and joy
And a love like mine, yeah baby
Is something nobody can ever destroy
You pick me up when I'm down
And when we go out, pretty baby
You shake up the whole town
And that's why
I believe you're my pride and joy
(Pride and joy)
(Pride and joy)
(Pride and joy)
(Pride and joy)
(Baby boy)
(Baby boy)
My pride and joy
And I love you like a baby loves his toy
