'Cause now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back
To me
Aww when Judy left with Johnny at my party (my party)
And came back wearing his ring
I sat down and cried my eyes out
Now that was a foolish thing
'Cause now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back
To me
Well it hurt me so to see them dance together
I felt like making a scene
Then my tears just felt like rain drops
'Cause Judy's smile was so mean
But now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back
To me
Oh one night I saw them kissing at a party
So I kissed some other guy
Johnny jumped up and he hit him
'Cause he still loved me that's why
So now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back
To me
So now it's Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
'Cause Johnny's come back
