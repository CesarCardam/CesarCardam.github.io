38. Tommy Roealbum
Everybody, everybody,
Everybody's, had a broken heart now.
Everybody, everybody,
Everybody's had the blues.
Everybody, everybody,
Everybody's, blue when they're lonesome.
Everybody, everybody,
Everybody's had the blues.
One time or other everybody listen to me,
You lose somebody you love
But that's no reason for you to break down and cry
I said a hey, everybody, everybody,
Everybody's, had a lonely moment.
Everybody, everybody,
Everybody's had the blues.
One time or other everybody listen to me,
You lose somebody you love.
That's no reason for you to break down
And cry.
I said a hey, everybody, everybody,
Everybody's, had a lonely moment.
Everybody, everybody,
Everybody's had the blues.
