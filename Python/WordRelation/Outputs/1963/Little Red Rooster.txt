67. Sam CookePortrait of a Legend 1951-1964 (Remastered)
I got a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
I got a little red rooster,
Too lazy to crow for day
He keeps everything in the barnyard,
Upset in every way
The dogs begin to bark
The hounds begin to howl
The dogs begin to bark now,
The hounds begin to howl
Watch out all you kin folk
My little red rooster's on the prowl
I tell you that he, keeps all the hens
Fighting among themselves
Keeps all the hens
Fighting among themselves
He don't want no hen in the barnyard
Laying eggs for nobody else
Let me tell everybody, now if you see my red rooster
Send him home
Said, if you see my red rooster
Send him home
I had no peace in the barnyard
Since my red rooster's been gone
