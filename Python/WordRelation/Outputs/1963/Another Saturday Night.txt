88. Sam CookePortrait of a Legend 1951-1964 (Remastered)
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now, how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way, dig this!
I got in town a month ago, I seen a lotta girls since then
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em but as yet I haven't met 'em
That's why I'm in the shape I'm in
Here another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now, how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
Now, another fella told me he had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of being my deliverance, she had a strange resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein
Here, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now, how I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful way
Here it is, another weekend and I ain't got nobody
Man, if I was back home I'd be swinging
Two chicks on my arm
Aww, yeah
Listen to me, huh
It's hard on a fella, when he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey to help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town
Here it's another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now, how I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful-
Everybody sing, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
Now, ow I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful-
One more time, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money 'cause I just got paid
How I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful way
Sounding mighty good, another Saturday night
