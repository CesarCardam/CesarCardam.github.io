62. Brenda Lee20th Century Masters: The Best Of Brenda Lee (Millenium Collection)
Don't sigh a sigh for me
Don't ever cry for me
This is goodbye for me
I know we're through
I'm losing you
Love sang it's song for me
Then things went wrong for me
Nights are too long for me
Because I'm losing you
Our love and our devotion
Were deep as any ocean
Then, one day, like the tide you began to change
And you became a perfect stranger
Someone is holding you
Sharing the lips I knew
I can't believe it's true
That I am losing you
