23. Bobby DarinIcon
You're the reason I'm living
You're the breath that I take
You're the stars in my heaven
You're the sun when I wake
You're the reason I'm living
You carry me through
All of life's little burdens
I'd be lost without you
A long, long time ago
When I was down
You picked me up
And showed me that true love
Still could be found
You're the reason I do things
You're the things that I do
You're the reason I'm livin'
I'd be lost without you
Tell me again (you're the reason I'm living)
Oh, you carry me through
All of life's little burdens
I'd be lost without you
