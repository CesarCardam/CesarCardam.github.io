I must be going (don't go)
My heart is showing (don't go)
I better hurry away
If I don't leave I'll be sorry
What will my Mary say
Your lips are thrilling
My arms are willing
I know that I shouldn't stay
If I don't leave I'll be sorry
What will my Mary say
What would I do if she should meet me
And find me kissing you
She's always trusted me completely
Her poor heart would break in two
I must be going (don't go)
My heart is showing (don't go)
I better hurry away
If I don't leave I'll be sorry
What will my Mary say
If I don't leave I'll be sorry
What will my Mary say
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
