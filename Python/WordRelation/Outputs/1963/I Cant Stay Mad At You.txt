43. Skeeter DavisThe End of the World [Gusto]
I can't stay mad at you
You can make me cry
You can break my heart
But I'll never say we're through
Even when I cry, I can't stay mad at you
You can run around
You can tell me lies
But there's nothing I can do
I'll never say goodbye
Cause I can't stay mad at you
I got mad at you last night
When you were holding another girl tight
But when I thought of all your charms
I bounced back in to your arms
One thing you'll know for sure
I won't be the one to fall in love with someone new
I'll love you til I die
And I can't stay mad at you
I bounced right back into your arms
One thing you'll know for sure
I won't be the one to fall in love with someone new
I'll love you til I die
And I can't stay mad at you
You got me where you want me
