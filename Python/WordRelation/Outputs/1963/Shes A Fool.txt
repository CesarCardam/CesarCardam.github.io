14. Lesley GoreThe Golden Hits of Lesley Gore
She don't know it she's a lucky girl
Got the best thing in the whole wide world
Got a love that's hard to find
Got the boy I wish was mine,
But, she's a fool
She's a fool
She has his love but treats him cruel
He don't know it but she cheats on him
With a boy like that it's such a sin
I would never be untrue
I would never make him blue
But, she's a fool
She's a fool
She has his love but treats him cruel
I know there is a gonna come a day
He will tell her girl be on your way
Maybe then he'll turn to me
Then how happy I will be, that
She's a fool
She's a fool
She has his love but treats him cruel
She's a fool
She's a fool
She has his love but treats him cruel
She's a fool
She's a fool
