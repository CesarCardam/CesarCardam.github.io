I Just Want To Celebrate another day of living,
I Just Want To Celebrate, another day of life.
I put my faith in the people, but the people let me down,
So I turn the other way and carry on anyhow.
That's why I'm telling you,
I Just Want To Celebrate another day of living,
I Just Want To Celebrate, another day of life.
I put my faith in the people, but the people let me down,
So I turn the other way and carry on anyhow.
Had my hand on a dollar bill and the dollar bill blew away,
But the sun is shining down on me and it's here to stay.
That's why I'm telling you.
I Just Want To Celebrate another day of living,
I Just Want To Celebrate, another day of life.
Don't let it get you down, no, no,
Don't let it turn you around and around
and around and around and around.
Well I can't be bothered with sorrow,
and I can't be bothered with hate,
I'm using up my time by feeling fine ev'ry day.
That's why I'm telling you,
I Just Want To Celebrate
I Just Want To Celebrate another day
I Just Want To Celebrate another day of living,
I Just Want To Celebrate, another day of life.
Don't let it get you down, no, no,
Don't let it turn you around and around
and around and around and around.
