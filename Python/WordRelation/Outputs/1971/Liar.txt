69. Three Dog Nightalbum
I won't ever leave while you want me to stay
Nothing you could do that would turn me away
Hanging on every word
Believing the things I heard
Being a fool
You've taken my life, so take my soul
That's what you said and I believed it all
I want to be with you as long
As you want me to
I won't move away
Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?
Liar, liar, liar
May I see no light
May I see no day
If I ever leave while you want me to stay
You can believe in me
I won't be leaving
I won't let you go
Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?
Liar, liar, liar
