08. John DenverThe Essential John Denver
Almost heaven, West Virginia,
Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River.
Life is old there,
Older than the trees,
Younger than the mountains
Growin' like a breeze.
Country roads, take me home
To the place where I belong:
West Virginia, mountain momma,
Take me home, country roads.
All my memories gathered 'round her,
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
Misty taste of moonshine,
Teardrop in my eye.
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong:
West Virginia, mountain momma,
Take me home, country roads.
I hear her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me,
Radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling that
I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home
To the place where I belong:
West Virginia, mountain momma,
Take me home, country roads.
