43. Ringo StarrAnd His All Starr Band
One, two,
One, two, three, four!
It don't come easy,
You know it don't come easy.
It don't come easy,
You know it don't come easy.
Got to pay your dues if you wanna sing the blues,
And you know it don't come easy.
You don't have to shout or leap about,
You can even play them easy.
Open up your heart, let's come together,
Use a little love
And we will make it work out better,
I don't ask for much, I only want your trust,
And you know it don't come easy.
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time,
And you know it don't come easy.
Peace, remember peace is how we make it,
Here within your reach
If you're big enough to take it.
Got to pay your dues if you wanna sing the blues,
And you know it don't come easy.
You don't have to shout or leap about,
You can even play them easy.
Peace, remember peace is how we make it,
Here within your reach
If you're big enough to take it.
I don't ask for much, I only want your trust,
And you know it don't come easy.
And this love of mine keeps growing all the time,
And you know it don't come easy.
"what's my name?" ringo!
"what's my name?" ringo!
"just in case anybody forgot."
