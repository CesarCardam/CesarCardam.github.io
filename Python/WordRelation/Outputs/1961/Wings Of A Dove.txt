38. Ferlin HuskyCountry Legends Back to Back, Vol. 3
[Chorus:]
On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above (Sign from above)
On the wings of a dove (Wings of a dove)
When troubles surround us, when evils come
The body grows weak (Body grows weak)
The spirit grows numb (Spirit grows numb)
When these things beset us, He doesn't forget us
He sends down His love (Sends down His love)
On the wings of a dove (Wings of a dove)
[Chorus]
When Noah had drifted on the flood many days
He searched for land (He searched for land)
In various ways (Various ways)
Troubles, he had some but wasn't forgotten
He sent him His love (Sent him His love)
On the wings of a dove (Wings of a dove)
[Chorus x 2]
On the wings of a dove (Wings of a dove)
[Repeat to Fade]
