73. Tony OrlandoBless You and Seventeen Other Great Hits
Ev'ry time I faced the world,
I just had to cry.
I stood alone with no love of my own,
But then you happened by,
Oh darlin', Bless You,
Bless ev'ry breath that you take,
Bless ev'ry move that you make so perfectly,
And bless your little heart for lovin' me,
Uuh, Bless You, Bless you, child!
Till you smiled and took my hand,
I felt kinda small,
But you stood by me for the whole world to see,
And then I was ten feet tall,
Oh darlin', Bless You, Bless ev'ry breath that you take,
Bless ev'ry move that you make so perfectly,
And bless your little heart for lovin' me.
