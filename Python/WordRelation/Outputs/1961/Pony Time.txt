It's pony time,
Boogety, boogety, boogety shoo
Hey now let's party with the union hall,
It's pony time when ya hear this call,
So get with it,
Don't quit it,
Get up.
Do the pony with your partner,
With a big boss line,
Well anyway ya do it,
You're gonna look real fine,
So get with it,
Don't quit it,
Get up.
Now ya turn to the left when I say gee,
You turn to the right when I say haw,
Now gee, ya ya baby,
Now haw, ya oh baby, oh baby, pretty baby,
Do it baby, oh baby, oh baby,
Boogety, boogety, boogety, boogety shoo.
Gonna see little Suzie, who lives next door,
She's doin' the pony, she's takin' the floor,
Eeea ah, so get with it, don't quit it, come on,
Boogety, boogety, boogety, boogety shoo.
Do the pony with your pardner,
Oh in a big boss line,
But anyway you do it,
You're gonna look just fine,
So get with, Don't quit it,
Come on. Eeeaaah
Now you turn to the left when I say gee,
You turn to the right when I say haw,
Now gee, ya ya little baby,
Now haw, ya oh baby, oh baby, pretty baby,
Do it baby, oh baby, oh baby,
Boogety, boogety, boogety, boogety shoo.
