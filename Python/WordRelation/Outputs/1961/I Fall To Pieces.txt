02. Patsy ClineSweet Dreams:
I fall to pieces
Each time I see you again
I fall to pieces
How can I be just your friend?
You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget (to forget)
Pretend we've never met (never met)
And I've tried and I've tried
But I haven't yet
You walk by and I fall to pieces
I fall to pieces
Each time someone speaks your name (speaks your name)
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the flame
