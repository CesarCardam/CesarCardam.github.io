78. Brook Bentonalbum
Think twice before you answer
Think twice before you say "Yes"
I'm asking you if you love me true
Because you're my happiness
Take your time, think it over
Think twice, then let me know
If you don't feel that your love is real
Tell me, although you'll hurt me so
Funny how a word can mean everything
That's why I want you to talk to me
To hear you say my name I'd give anything
Only you can decide what my future will be
Think twice before you answer
Think twice, whatever you do
A love as strong as mine can stand the test of time
Think twice of the one who loves you
