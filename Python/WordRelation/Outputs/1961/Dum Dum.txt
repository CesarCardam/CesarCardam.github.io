91. Brenda Lee20th Century Masters: The Best Of Brenda Lee (Millenium Collection)
A dum dum, a deedly dum
Uh huh huh, a dum dum, a deedly dum
Oh yeah, dum dum, a deedly dum
A music's sweet the lights are low
Playing a song on the radio
Your ma's in the kitchen
Your pa's next door
I want to love you just a little bit more
Singing dum dum, a deedly dum
Uh huh, dum dum, a deedly dum
Sing it out, dum dum, a deedly dum
Come on baby, don't you be so shy
You know that I love you, let me tell you why
You got a heart I know that it's true
I couldn't love you any more than I do
Singing dum dum, a deedly dum
Oh yeah, dum dum, a deedly dum
One more time, dum dum, a deedly dum
Ah, I want you with me all of the time
Tell me you love me and you'll be mine
There's so many things that we could do
So say the words and make my dreams come true
Singing dum dum, a deedly dum
Uh huh, dum dum, a deedly dum
Sing it out, dum dum, a deedly dum
A dum dum, a deedly dum
Sing it out, dum dum, a deedly dum
I can't hear ya, dum dum, a deedly dum
