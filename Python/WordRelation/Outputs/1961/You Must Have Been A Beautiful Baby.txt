Oh you know, you know, you know
You must have been a beautiful baby
You must have been a wonderful child
When you were only starting
To go to kindergarten
I bet you drove those other childs wild
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
And when it came to winning blue ribbons
Well, I bet you taught the other kids how
Well, I can see the judge's eyes
As they handed you the prize
I bet you took the cutest bow
Yeah, you must a been a beautiful baby
'Cause baby won't you look at you now
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
You must a have been a beautiful baby
You must a have been a beautiful child
When you were only startin'
To go to kindergarten
I know you drove the other childs wild
An' I wasn't even there
An' when you came to winnin' blue ribbons
Hey, I know you taught those other kids how
Well, I can see the judge's eyes
As they handed you the prize
I know you made the cutest bow
Yeah, you must a been a beautiful baby
'Cause baby won't you look at you now
Oh, I mean, I mean, oh, beautiful
Oh, beautiful
Oh, beautiful
Oh, beautiful
Oh, beautiful
Oh, beautiful
Aah, I know you're beautiful
Too beautiful for words
