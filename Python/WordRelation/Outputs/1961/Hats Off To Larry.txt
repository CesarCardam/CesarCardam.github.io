68. Del ShannonRunaway Hits of Del Shannon
Once I had a pretty girl,
Her name it doesn't matter
She went away with another guy
Now he won't even look at her
Hats off to Larry,
He broke your heart,
Just like you broke mine when you
Said we must part.
He told you lies, now it's
Your turn to cry cry cry-why
Now that Larry said goodbye to you.
I know this may sound strange
I want you back, I think you'll change
But there's one more thing I gotta say
Hats off to Larry,
It may sound cruel,
But you laughed at me when you
Said we were through.
You told me lies, now it's
Your turn to cry cry cry-why
Now that Larry said goodbye to you.
