37. Johnny Tillotsonalbum
You made me happy, you made me sing
But now without you, I've lost everything
And I know, know it's true that I-I must go throu-ou-gh
All my life (all my life) all my life (all my life)
Wi-ithout yo-ou-ou (wi-ithout you)
No one to talk to when I'm alone
No one to call me, call me her own
And I know, know it's true that I-I must go throu-ou-gh
All my life (all my life) all my life (all my life)
Wi-ithout yo-ou-ou (wi-ithout you)
(dum-dumb-dumb-dum)
Maybe tomorrow
(dum-dumb-dumb-dum)
Maybe in time
(dum-dumb-dumb-dum)
I'll find an angel
(dum-dumb-dumb-dum)
Who wants to be mine
(dum-dumb-dumb-dum)
Someone who needs me
(dum-dumb-dumb-dum)
Like I'm needing you
(dum-dumb-dumb-dum)
Someone to love me and to always be true
But, oh my darling (oh-oh oh yes)
I love you still (he loves you still)
I dream about you (oh-oh oh yes)
And I always will (he always will)
And I know, know it's true that I-I must go throu-ou-gh
All my life (all my life) all my life (all my life)
Wi-ithout you (wi-ithout you)
