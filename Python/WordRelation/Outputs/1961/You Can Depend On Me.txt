93. Brenda Lee20th Century Masters: The Best Of Brenda Lee (Millenium Collection)
Though you say we're through
I'll always love you
And you can depend on me
Though someone that you've met
Has made you forget
Honey, you know
You can count on me
When I wish, I wish you success
And loads, loads of happiness
But baby, I gotta confess
I'll be lonely
If you ever, ah, if you ever need a friend
I'll be yours until the end
And you can depend on me
I wish you success
And loads of happiness
But, darling, I gotta confess
I'm gonna be lonely
