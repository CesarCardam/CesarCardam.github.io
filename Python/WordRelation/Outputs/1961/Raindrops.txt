09. Dee ClarkHey Little Girl (Charly R&amp;B Masters Vol.19)
The raindrops, so many raindrops
It feels like rai-ain drops
Falling from my eye-eyes
Falling from my eyes
Since my love has left me
I'm so all alone
I would bring her back to me
But I don't know where she's go-o-o-ne
I don't know where she's gone
There must be a cloud in my hea-ea-ea-ead
Rain keeps falling from my eye, eyes
Oh no they can't be teardrops
For a man ain't supposed to cry
So it must be rai-ain drops, so many raindrops
It feels like raindrops
Falling from my eye,eyes
Falling from my eyes
Oh, there must be a cloud in my hea-ea-ea-ead
Rain keeps falling from my eye-eyes
Oh no they can't be teardrops
For a man ain't supposed to cry
So it must be rai-ain drops, so many raindrops
It feels like raindrops
Falling from my eye, eyes
Falling from my eyes
It keeps on fallin'
Fallin' from my eyes
It keeps on fallin' from my eyes
