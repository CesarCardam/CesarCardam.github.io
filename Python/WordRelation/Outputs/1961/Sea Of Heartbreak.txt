The lights in the harbor
Don't shine for me
I'm like a lost ship
Adrift on the sea
[Chorus:]
Sea of heartbreak
Lost love and loneliness
Memories of your caress
So divine, how I wish
You were mine again my dear
I'm on this sea of tears
Sea of heartbreak
Oh how did I lose you
Oh where did I fail
Why did you leave me
Always to sail
[Chorus]
Oh what I'd give just to sail back to shore
Back to your arms once more
Oh come to my rescue
Oh come here to me
Take me and keep me
Away from the sea
[Chorus]
