94. Chubby Checkeralbum
Come on everybody clap your hands
Ahhh you're looking good
I'm gonna sing my song and you won't take long
We gonna do the twist and it goes like this
Come on let's twist again like we did last summer
Yea, let's twist again like we did last year
Do you remember when things were really hummin'
Yea, let's twist again, twistin' time is here
Round 'n around 'n up 'n down we go again
Oh baby make me know you love me so again
Twist again like we did last summer
Come on twist again, like we did last year
Who's that, flyin' up there?
Is it a bird? no
Is it a plane? no
Is it the twister? yeah
Twist again like we did last summer
Come on let's twist again, like we did last year
Do you remember when things were really hummin'
Come on let's twist again, twistin' time is here
Round 'n around 'n up 'n down we go again
Oh baby make me know you love me so again
Come on twist again like we did last summer
Girl let's twist again, like we did last year
Come on twist again, twistin' time is here
