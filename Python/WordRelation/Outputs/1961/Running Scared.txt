13. Roy OrbisonThe Soul of Rock and Roll
Just runnin' scared
Each place we go
So afraid
That he might show
Yeah, runnin' scared
What would I do
If he came back
And wanted you?
Just runnin' scared
Feelin' low
Runnin' scared
You love him so
Just runnin' scared
Afraid to lose
If he came back
Which one would you choose?
Then all at once he was standing there
So sure of himself, his head in the air
My heart was breaking, which one would it be?
You turned around and walked away with me
