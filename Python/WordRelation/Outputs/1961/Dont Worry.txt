Don't worry 'bout me, it's all over now
Though I may be blue, I'll manage somehow.
Love can't be explained, can't be controlled
One day it's warm, next day it's cold.
Don't pity me 'cause I'm feelin' blue;
Don't be ashamed, it might have been you.
Oh-oh-oh, oh, love,
Kiss me one time, then go, love,
I understand, don't worry 'bout me.
Sweet, sweet, sweet love, I want you to be
As happy as I when you loved me.
I'll never forget you, your sweet memory
It's all over now, don't worry 'bout me.
When one heart tells one heart, one heart good-bye,
One heart is free; one heart will cry.
Oh-oh-oh, oh, sweet, sweet baby, sweet baby, sweet,
It's all right, don't worry 'bout me.
