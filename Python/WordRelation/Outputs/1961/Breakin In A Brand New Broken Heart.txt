80. Connie FrancisThe Complete US Singles As &amp; Bs: 1955-62
If my friends should ask for me,
Here at home is where I'll be
There's no one I care to see,
I'm breakin' in a brand new broken heart
Now the heartaches have begun;
There's a job that must be done
I'll have no time for havin' fun,
I'm breakin' in a brand new broken heart
Oh, leave me alone, and let me cry, cry, cry
There are tears that must be cried,
Till there are no more tears inside
Let me take a count of ten,
Then I'll bounce right back again
Let me be alone till then,
I'm breakin' in a brand new broken heart
I'm breakin' in a brand new broken heart
