82. Fats DominoThe Legends of New Orleans: Fats Domino Live!
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Let me hold your hand
Try to understand
I want a girl like you
To tell my troubles to
Don't be afraid
You heard what I said
Let the four winds blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the east to the west
I'll love you the best
Let the four winds blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the east to the west
I'll love you the best
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Let me hold your hand
Try to understand
I want a girl like you
To tell my troubles to
Don't be afraid
You heard what I said
Let the four winds blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the east to the west
I'll love you the best
Let the four winds blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the east to the west
I'll love you the best
