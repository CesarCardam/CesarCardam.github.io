Hey come on everybody and do the fly with me

All the girls and guys are getting the [ ] they're gonna fly
Oh you pretty little girl come and fly away with me
Hey pretty little girl fly away with me

You've gotta shake your hands all around and around the sky
And then you buzz around the floor
You can do it if you really try
All the girls and guys are getting the [ ] they're gonna fly

Hey come on everybody and do the fly with me
