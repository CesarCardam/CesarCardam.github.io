92. Eddie Hodgesalbum
I'm gonna knock on your door, ring on your bell
Tap on your window too
If you don't come out tonight when the moon bright
I'm gonna knock and ring and tap until you do
I'm gonna knock on your door, call out your name
Wake up the town, you'll see
I'm gonna hoot and howl like a lovesick owl
Until you say you're gonna come out with me
BRIDGE:
Hey little girl, this ain't no time to sleep
Let's count kisses 'stead of countin' sheep
How, how can I hold you near
With you up there and me down here
REPEAT VERSE 1
