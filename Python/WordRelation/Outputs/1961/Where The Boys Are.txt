Where the boys are
Someone waits for me,
A smiling face, a warm embrace,
Two arms to hold me tenderly
Where the boys are
My true love will be,
He's walking down some street in town
And I know he's looking there for me
In the crowd of a million people
I'll find my valentine,
Then I'll climb to the highest steeple
And tell the world he's mine
'Til he holds me
I wait impatiently
Where the boys are, where the boys are
Where the boys are, someone waits for me
'Til he holds me
I wait impatiently.
Where the boys are, where the boys are
Where the boys are, someone waits for me
