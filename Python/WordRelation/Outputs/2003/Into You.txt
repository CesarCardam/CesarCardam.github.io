23. Fabolous Featuring Tamia Or AshantiStreet Dreams
Baby girl (I'll really like)
Desert Storm (yeah)
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now
I wanna be more than a friend to you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the 90s in the two thou
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
'Cause the kids ready to tell you how he feel and a few vows
Maybe I speak in general now
But girl, Imma do whatever just to keep a grin on u now
Where I roll, they wear bikinis in the winter too now
What you think about tan lines on the skin of you now?
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou
On Fifth Ave, shopping sprees and them dinners to chow
I ain't concerned with other men with you now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a king to you now
And I ain't jealous, it's the principle now
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
Come on ma
It's more than a flashing
I woulda traded it all in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashing
Just off the shore so you can hear when the water be splashing
The Drop top three in the quota we dashing
Flawless diamonds in the water we flashing
The money we oughta be stashing
I make sure ever quarter be cashed in
I can't really explain it
My friends be thinking I'm slipping
These girls be thinking I'm tripping
What kinda weed youu be smoking
What typa drinks youu be sipping
Sweet thing just to think of you dipping
Would have me with the blue so hard
You would think I was crimping
Now you relaxing in the Benz
Credit cards are no limits
So you don't worry about maxing when u spends
But since you been asking about the friends
How'd you like it if both our names had Jackson on the ends
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I don't wanna trip, but the truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak
Remind me of them trips to Ruth's Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you it ain't because my whips is ruthless
So sit on chrome, dip the deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary's and VS dip tay seuces
All the ballers look dumb when they press you
Five and sixes, you don't let them kinda #'s impress you
Even though I was so unsuccessful
Being a player was becoming too stressful
But ever since, this superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
That's why the same bar while the villa been painted
Just so we can really get acquainted
The love is real, there's no way you can feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, yeah
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
