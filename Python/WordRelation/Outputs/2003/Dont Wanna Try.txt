71. Frankie JThe One
I can't believe you had the nerve to say the things you said
It hurt so bad that they ended our relationship
I can't believe it
Four years go down the drain
How I wish things would have happened so differently
I tried to say this many times but still you couldn't see
You kept insisting and resisting
That you would not fall again
And now you're trying to tell me that you're sorry
And you're trying to come back home
You're telling me you really need me
Crying begging both knees on the floor
But baby, I
Don't want to try
Don't want to try
Don't want to try no more
You keep insisting
When you know our love is out the door
Don't want to try
Don't want to try cause all we do is fight
And say the things that we want to hold back?
To where we both begin to cry
Don't want to try
Don't want to try about your sadden love
It's been a rough road
Baby just let it go
Don't want to try
Don't want to try
Don't want to try no more
Tell me what's the use of holding on
When all we do is hurt our love
You've died? in many conversations on the telephone
Talks about one day of having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
But all of that seems so far away from me
Had to wake up face reality
It all just seemed to good to be true
After all you put me through
And now you're trying to tell me that you're sorry
And you're trying to come back home
You're telling me you really need me
Crying begging both knees on the floor
But baby, I
Don't want to try
Don't want to try
Don't want to try no more
You keep insisting
When you know our love is out the door
Don't want to try
Don't want to try cause all we do is fight
And say the things that we want to hold back?
To where we both begin to cry.
Don't want to try
Don't want to try about your sadden love
It's been a rough road
Baby just let it go
Don't want to try
Don't want to try
Don't want to try no more
Tell me what's the use of holding on
When all we do is hurt our love
