83. AshantiChapter II
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
I'm lookin' in the mirror
At this woman down and out
She's internally dyin'
I know this was not what love's about
I don't wanna be this woman
The second time around
'Cause I'm wakin' up screamin', no longer believin'
That I'm gonna be around
And over and over I tried
Yet over and over you lied
Gettin' over and over my pride, yeah
I don't know why
And over and over I tried
Yet over and over you lied
Gettin' over and over my pride, yeah
I don't know why
Rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe
Baby, just rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe, no
See, I don't want to hold my pillow late at night no more
I'm tossin' and turnin' and thinkin' 'bout burnin' down these walls
I-I don't wanna fuel this fire no more, no more, no more
See, I made up my mind 'cause I've wasted my time
Ain't nothin' here to keep me warm
And over and over I tried
Yet over and over you lied
Gettin' over and over my pride, yeah
I don't know why
And over and over I tried
Yet over and over you lied
Gettin' over and over my pride, yeah
I cried, I cried, I cried, I cried, I cried
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe
Baby, just rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe, no
I'm so tired of the rain
In my life
And I'm so tired of the strain
And now you're gonna lie
Sometimes I can't sleep at night and
This here it just don't seem right and
Sometimes I just wonder why I
Almost let my life go by
Sometimes I can't sleep at night and
This here it just don't seem right and
Sometimes I just wonder why I
Almost let my life go by
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe
Baby, just rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe, no
Rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe
Baby, just rain on me
Lord, won't you take this pain from me
I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe, no
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
Ooh, ooh, ooh
