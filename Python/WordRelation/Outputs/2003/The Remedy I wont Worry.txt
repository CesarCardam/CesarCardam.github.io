52. Jason MrazTonight Not Again/Live at Eagles Ballroom
Well I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away
'cause you were born on the 4th of July (freedom ring)
Well something on the surface it stings
I said something on the surface
Well it kinda makes me nervous
To say that you deserve this
And what kind of God would serve this
We would cure this dirty old disease
Well, if you gots the poison
I gots the remedy
The remedy is the experience
This is the dangerous liaison (I says)
The comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well it all amounts to nothing in the end
And I won't worry my life away
Hey hey hey, oh oh
I won't worry my life away
Hey hey hey, oh oh
Well I heard 2 men talking on the radio
In a cross-fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
Well they were counting down the ways to stab a brother in the Be right back after this
The unavoidable kiss
With the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast this catastrophe
Dance with me
Well if you gots the poison, I gots the remedy
The remedy is the experience
This is the dangerous liaison (I says)
The comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well it all amounts to nothing in the end
And I won't worry my life away
Hey hey hey, oh oh
I won't worry my life away
Hey hey hey, oh oh
When I fall in love, I take my time
There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun, but I'm still gonna shine
And I'll tell you why
Because
The remedy is the experience
This is the dangerous liaison (I says)
The comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well it all amounts to nothing in the end
