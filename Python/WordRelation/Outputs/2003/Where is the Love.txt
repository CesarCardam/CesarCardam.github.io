What's wrong with the world mama
People livin' like ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to the things that'll bring the trauma
Over seas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorist here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods, and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for you own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how this angle works and operates
Man, you got to have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love y'all
