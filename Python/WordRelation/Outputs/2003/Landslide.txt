35. Dixie ChicksTop Of The World Tour
I took my love and I took it down
Climbed a mountain then I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well the landslide brought me down
Oh, mirror in the sky
What is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life
Uh ah
Uh ah
Uh ah
Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older too
Well
Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older too
Well, I'm getting older too
So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and ya turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well the landslide brought me down
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well maybe
Well maybe
Well maybe
The landslide will bring you down.
