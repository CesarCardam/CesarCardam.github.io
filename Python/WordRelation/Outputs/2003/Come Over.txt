Quarter after two (black 1-0-2)
I know it's late(real late)
But I'm calling you(calling you)
Trying to figure if i(i)
Can(can)
Come(come)
See(see)
You(can I come see you)
I know your asleep(you asleep)
But your on my mind(my mind)
And I'm wide awake(awake)
And I want to stop by(come on over)
So can you get up and get out of the bed
'Cause I want to see you
And I've been wonderin'
Can I come over
Can I (come over)stop by(come over)to see you
(Come over)tonight
Can I come over
Can I (come over) get wit' you(come over)
Just wanna(come over)be wit' you

Just wanna(come over)be wit' you
Can I come over
Tell me what the deal
Your not that far
Jus' got my bags
And I'm headed to tha car
Say yes or no
'Cause I'm on the road
(Um, wait a minute my battery's low, let me, alright)
Baby, I want to come see you
Said I really want to come see you
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Just wantin' to hold you
And brace you
I want to
Look at you and tell you how much I love you
I want you, I need you, miss you
Can I come over
Can I (come over)stop by(come over)to see you
(Come over)tonight

Just wanna(come over)be wit' you
