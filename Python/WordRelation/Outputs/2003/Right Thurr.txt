Uh, hey dirty, (what?)
Look at that girl right there (oh)
She make me say
Ooh, ooh, (yeah) ooh, ooh, (hey) do what you do
Chorus:
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Swing your hips when you're walkin', let down you're hurr (let down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talkin', that make me sturr
[Chingy]
I like the way you look in them pants, see ya fine (fine)
Your momma a quarter piece, she far from a dime (dime)
The type of girl that'll getcha' up and go make you grind (grind)
I'm thinkin' about snatchin' her up, dirty, makin' her mine
Look at her hips, (what?) look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (stacked)
I sure wouldn't mind hittin' that from the back (back)
I like it when I touch it 'cause she moan a l'il bit
Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a l'il bit
I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the regal
I swooped on her like an eagle swoopin' down on its prey
I know you popular, but you gon' be famous today
[Chorus] - repeat 2X
[Chingy]
She be shoppin' in Frontenac
Just look at her front and back
Man she so stacked and she know that I want that
Her man, he's so wack, girl can I taste yo khaki
for three hundred to step, like buyin' a throwback
She stay in the club,(club) I can be seein' she got it honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events, (yeah) so I'm impressed when she pass (yeah)
All the high rollin' cats want to pay for that ass
Ain't no half steppin', (steppin') she strapped wit a nice weapon (weapon)
Trick, it's against the law for her to move them hips
If you ever seen her dirty, your mouth gon' drop
Worldwide fools probably tell you this off tops
[Chorus] - repeat 2X
[Chingy]
I like the way she doin' that (c'mon)
Plus I like it when she bring it back (say it)
Ooh, (uh-huh) ooh, ooh, ooh, (uh-huh) do what you do (whoo)
I like the way she doin' that (c'mon)
Plus I like it when she bring it back (say it)
Ooh, (uh-huh) ooh, ooh, ooh, (uh-huh) do what you do (whoo)
[Chingy]
Gimme what you got for a pork chop (uh)
She threw it at me like I was a short-stop (uh)
Workin' in a Fatty Girl Hugga Top
Then she back it up on me and let it drop (drop)
Make it hop (boing) like a bunny (bunny)
Girl can I touch you where it's sunny
or a purse and make you give her some money
She should pose for Sports Illustrated
It's like a picture perfect site
When she pass all the other girls hate it
(But I...)
[Chorus] - repeat 2X
I like that (uh-huh)
I like that (uh-huh)
I like that (uh-huh)
I like that (Track stars)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, do what you do
I like that (yeah)
I like that (yeah)
I like that (yeah)
I like that (Chingy)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, do what you do
