33. Wayne Wonderalbum
Got somebody she's a beauty
Very special really and truly
Take good care of me like it's her duty
Want you right by my side night and day
No letting go no holding back
Because you are my lady
When I'm with you it's all a that
Girl I'm so glad we've dated
No letting go no holding back
No holding back no
When I'm with you it's all a that
All a that
They say good things must come to an end
But I'm optimistic about being your friend
Though I made you cry by my doings
With Keisha and Annesha but that
Was back then
No letting go no holding back
Because you are my lady
When I'm with you it's all a that
Girl I'm so glad we've dated
No letting go no holding back
No holding back no
When I'm with you it's all a that
All a that
Really appreciate you loving me
After all that we've been through
Really appreciate you loving me
All times, time
Got somebody she's a beauty
Very special really and truly
Take good care of me like it's her duty
Want you right by my side night and day
No letting go no holding back
Because you are my lady
When I'm with you it's all a that
Girl I'm so glad we've dated
No letting go, no holding back
No holding back no
