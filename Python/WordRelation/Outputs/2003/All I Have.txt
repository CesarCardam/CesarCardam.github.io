15. Jennifer Lopez Featuring LL Cool JDance Again: The Hits (Deluxe Version)
Love is life and life is living
It's very special
All my love
Oh
(Baby, don't go)
(Baby, don't go) Yeah
(Baby, don't go, uh)
(Baby, don't go) Yeah
(Baby, don't go)
(Baby, don't go) Yeah, yeah
(Why you act like that?)
It's such a shame, but I'm leaving
Can't take the way you mistreated me
And it's crazy, but oh, baby
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby let's talk about this, man
Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son
I gotta leave you alone
'Cause I'm good holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right
All my pride is all I have
(Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have)
You'll be needing me, but too bad
(Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad)
The path you chose to run alone
(I know you're independent, you can make it on your own)
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
(But time is of the essence, why spend it alone, huh)
The nights I waited up for you (oh, boy)
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creeping all over town
I thought my tender touch could lock you down
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
The way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now, come here
Stop playing you gamin'
I gotta leave you alone
'Cause I'm good holding down my spot (stop acting like that)
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block (now you know you need to stop)
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right (here we go)
All my pride is all I have
(Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have)
You'll be needing me, but too bad
(Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad)
The path you chose to run alone
(I know you're independent, you can make it on your own)
Here with me you had a home
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone, huh
People make mistakes to make up, to break up
To wake up cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me
You love me, I'm like your homey
Instead of beef you come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony
Don't bounce, baby, console me, come here
Ain't nothing you can say to me that can change my mind
I gotta let you go now
And nothing will ever be the same, so just be on your way
Go ahead and do your thing now
And there's no more to explain to me, you know
I know your game and I'm feeling what you do
So I'm bouncing and I'm out, son
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah
All my pride is all I have
(Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have)
You'll be needing me, but too bad
(Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad)
The path you chose to run alone
(I know you're independent, you can make it on your own)
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
(But time is of the essence, why spend it alone, huh)
All my pride is all I have
(Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have)
You'll be needing me, but too bad
(Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad)
The path you chose to run alone
(I know you're independent, you can make it on your own)
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
(But time is of the essence, why spend it alone, huh)
I promise you
You know what I'm sayin'
