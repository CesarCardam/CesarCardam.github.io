Circling your head contemplating everything you ever said
Now I see the truth I got a doubt
A different motive in your eyes and now I'm out
See you later
I see your fantasies
You wanna make it a reality baby paved in gold
See inside, inside of our heads yeah
Well now that's over
I see your motives inside
Decisions to hide
Back off I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
Headstrong we're Headstrong
Back off I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
This is not where you belong
I can't give everything away
I won't give everything away
Conclusions manifest your first impressions got to be your very best
I see you're full of shit is not so right
That's how you play I guess you get through every night
Now that's over
I see your fantasies
You wanna make it a reality
Paved in gold
See inside, inside of our heads
Well now that's over
I see your motives inside
And your decisions to hide
Back off I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on any one
I know that you are wrong
Headstrong, we're headstrong
Back off I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
And this is not where you belong
Where you belong
I can't give everything away
This is not where you belong
I won't give everything away
I know I know all about
I know I know all about
I know I know all about
I know I know all about
Your motives inside
And your decision to hide
Back off I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
Headstrong,we're headstrong
Back off I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
And this is not where you belong
Where you belong

I won't give everything away
Where you belong
This is not where you belong
