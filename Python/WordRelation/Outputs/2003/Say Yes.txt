See I've been watching you for a while your smile and stuff
And I don't know if I can be with you for tonight, alright
Is that alright, baby, baby
There is only one for me
You have made that a possibility
We could take that step to see
If this is really gonna be
All you gotta do is say yes
All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel let me undress you, babe
Open up your mind and just rest
I'm about to let you know you make me so
All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel let me undress you, babe
Open up your mind and just rest
I'm about to let you know you make me so, so
So, so, so, so, so, so
You make me so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so
Loving you has taken time, take time
But I always knew you could be mine
I recognize the butterflies inside me
Sense is gonna be made tonight, tonight
All you gotta do is say yes
All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel let me undress you, babe
Open up your mind and just rest
I'm about to let you know you make me so
Don't deny what you feel let me undress you, babe
Open up your mind and just rest
I'm about to let you know you make me so, so
So, so, so, so, so, so
You make me so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so
You make me so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so
You make me so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so
All you gotta do, all you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel let me undress you, baby
Open up your mind and just rest
I'm about to let you know you make me so
All you gotta do is say yes
