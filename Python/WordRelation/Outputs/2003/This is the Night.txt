47. Clay AikenMeasure Of A Man
When the world was in upside down
I could take all the time I had
But I'm not gonna wait
When a moment can vanish so fast
Cause every kiss is a kiss you can never get back
Lift me up in your arms
If you told me that's where heaven is
(Well, you'd be right)
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night
When the answer to all my dreams
Is as close as a touch away
Why am I here holding back what I'm trying to say
Lift me up in your arms
If you told me that is where heaven is
(Well, you'd be right)
Hold me close to your heart
I will go with you to the end of the Earth
(And we'll fly)
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night
This is the night where we capture forever
And all out tomorrows begin
After tonight we will never be lonely again
Lift me up in your arms
If you told me that is where heaven is
(Well, you'd be right)
Hold me close to your heart
I would go with you to the end of the Earth
(And we'll fly)
I've been waiting forever for this
This is the night
