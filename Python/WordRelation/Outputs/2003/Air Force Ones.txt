(Big boy) size twelve with the strap, red and white with a cardinal cap
(Big boy) all flavors well it just depend

Lows mids and high tops (Big boy) With the clear sole,
But this Tims and fat laces with it is cold
(Big boy) but when the winter goes and the hot summer flows
(Big boy) then it's back to the all purpose with em and dots in the toe
(Big boy) then I'm stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sure
(Big boy) on them Nike Air Force "N" "E" behind the "O" (big boy)
Ok li, I treat my shoe like my ride
(Big boy) chrome on the fat laces at what wood on the inside
(Big boy) spray candy on the swoosh
With the electric poofs
