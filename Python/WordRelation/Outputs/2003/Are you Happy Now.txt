56. Michelle BranchHotel Paper
Now
Don't just walk away
Pretending everythings okay and you don't care about me
And I know it's just no use
When all your lies become your truths and I don't care
Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now
Would you tell it to my face
Have I been erased
Are you happy now
Are you happy now
You took all there was to take
And left me with an empty plate
And you don't care about it
Yeah
And I am giving up this game
And leaving you with all the blame
Cause I don't care
Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now
Would you tell it to my face
Have I been erased
Are you happy now
Are you happy now
Are you happy now
Do you really have everything you want?
You could never give something you ain't got
You can't run away from yourself
Could you look me in the eye
And tell me that you're happy now
Would you tell it to my face
Have I been erased
Are you happy now
Are you happy now
Would you look me in the eye
Could you look me in the eye
I've had all that I can take
I'm not about to break
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
