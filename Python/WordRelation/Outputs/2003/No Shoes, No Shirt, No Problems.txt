91. Kenny ChesneyNo Shoes No Shirts No Problems
I've been up to my neck
Workin' six days a week.
Wearin' holes in the soles
Of the shoes on my feet.
Been dreamin' of gettin' away
Since I don't know.
Ain't no better time than now for Mexico
No shoes, no shirt, and no problems
Blues, what blues?
Hey I forgot 'em.
The sun and the sand,
And a drink in my hand with no bottom,
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems,
No problems.
Want a towel on a chair
In the sand by the sea,
Want to look through my shades,
And see you there with me.
Want to soak up life for a while,
In laid back mode.
No boss, no clock, no stress, no dress code
No shoes, no shirt, no problems
Blues, what blues?
Hey I forgot 'em.
The sun and the sand,
And a drink in my hand with no bottom,
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems,
