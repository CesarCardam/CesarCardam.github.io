69. Amanda PerezI Pray
It's been five months since you went away
Left without a word and nothing to say
When I was the one who gave you my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you
So I ask God
God, send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart for being in love
All I do, is cry
Send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
I know I may sound crazy
But after all that I still love you
You want to come back in my life
But now there's something I have to do
I have to tell the one I once adore
That they can't have my love no more
My heart can't take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries
God, send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart for being in love
All I do, is cry
Send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
Now you have me on my knees
Begging God please to send you back to me
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep,
You made me feel like I could not breathe
When all I wanted to do was feel your touch
And to give you all my love
But you took my love for granted
Want my loving now, but you can't have it
Oh God
God, send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart for being in love
All I do, is cry
Send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
Oh God
God, send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart for being in love
All I do, is cry
Send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
