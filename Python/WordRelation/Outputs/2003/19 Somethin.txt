84. Mark Willsalbum
I saw Star Wars at least eight times
Had the Pac Man pattern memorized
And I've seen the stuff they put inside
Stretch Armstrong
I was Roger Staubach in my back yard
Had a shoe box full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evel Knievel scars
On my right arm
I was a kid when Elvis died
And my momma cried
It was nineteen seventy somethin'
In the world that I grew up in
Farrah Fawcett harido days
Bell bottoms and eight tracks tapes
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh man did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Nineteen seventy somethin'
It was the dawning of a new decade
When we got our first microwave
And Dad broke down and finally shaved
Them old sideburns off
I took the stickers off of my Rubik's Cube
Watched MTV all afternoon
And my first love was Daisy Duke
In them cut off jeans
A space shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried
It was nineteen eighty somethin'
In the world that I grew up in
Skatin' rinks and black Trans Am's
Big hair and parachute pants
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh man did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Nineteen eighty somethin'
Now I've got a mortgage and an S.U.V.
And all this responsibility
Makes me wish sometimes
It was nineteen seventy somethin'
In the world that I grew up in
Farrah Fawcett harido days
Bell bottoms and eight tracks tapes
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh man did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Nineteen seventy somethin'
Oh was it eighty somethin'
It was nineteen somethin'
