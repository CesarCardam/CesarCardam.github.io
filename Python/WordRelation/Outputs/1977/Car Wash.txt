Ooh ooh
You might not ever get rich
But let me tell ya it's better than diggin' a ditch
There ain't no tellin' who you might meet
A movie star or maybe even an Indian chief
(Workin')
At the car wash
Workin' at the car wash, yeah
Come on and sing it with me
(Car wash)
Sing it with the feelin' y'all
(Car wash, yeah)
Ooh!
Come summer the work gets kinda hot
This ain't no place to be if you planned on bein' a star
Let me tell you it's always cool
And the boss don't mind sometimes if you act a fool
At the car wash
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Talkin' about the car wash, yeah
Come on, ya'all and sing it for me
(Car wash)
Wooh oooh oooh
(Car wash, yeah)
(Work and work)
Well, those cars never seem to stop coming
(Work and work)
Keep those rags and machines humming
(Work and work)
My fingers to the bone
(Work)
I can't wait till it's time to go home
(Hey, get your car washed today)
Fill up and you don't have to pay
Come on and give us a play
(Do the wash, right away)
(The car wash)
Talkin' 'bout the car wash
Car wash, yeah
Come on, y'all, let's sing it with me
(Car wash)
Sing it with feelin', y'all
(Car wash, yeah)
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
(Car wash)
Those cars never seem to stop comin'
What'd I say
Keep those rags and machines hummin'
(Car wash)
Let me tell you, it's always cool
And the boss don't mind sometimes if you act a fool
At the car wash
Workin' at the car wash yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Car wash
Talkin' about the car wash
Car wash
Car wash yeah
Car wash
Car wash yeah
