77. Electric Light OrchestraLight Years
Sailin' away on the crest of a wave
It's like magic
Oh, rollin' and ridin' and slippin' and slidin'
It's magic
And you, and your sweet desire
You took me, ohh, higher and higher, baby
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
I'm takin' a dive
Making believe this is what you've conceived
From your worst day, I'm takin' a dive
Oh, moving in line when you look back in time
To the first day, I'm takin', I'm takin'
And you and your sweet desire
You took me (Don't you do it, don't you do it), ohh, higher and higher baby
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
And I'm takin' a dive, ah the slide, hey
Takin' a dive 'cause you can't halt the slide
Floating downstream, I'm takin a dive
Ah, so let her go don't start spoiling the show
It's a bad dream, I'm takin', I'm takin'
And you and your sweet desire
You took me(Don't you do it, don't you do it), ohh, higher and higher, baby
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
It's a livin' thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose
