68. ForeignerForeigner
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You never take advice
Someday you'll pay the price, I know
I've seen it before
It happens all the time
Closing the door
You leave the world behind
You're digging for gold
Yet throwing away
A fortune in feelings
But someday you'll pay
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You want paradise
But someday you'll pay the price, I know
I've seen it before
It happens all the time
Closing the door
You leave the world behind
You're digging for gold
Yet throwing away
A fortune in feelings
But someday you'll pay
(Cold as ice)
You know that you are
(Cold as ice)
As cold as ice to me
(Cold as ice)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, you're as cold as ice)
(You're as cold as ice)
You're as cold as ice
Cold as ice I know
Yes, I know
You're as cold as ice
Cold as ice I know
Oh, yes I know
You're as cold as ice
Cold as ice I know
Oh, yes I know
