74. Boz ScaggsBOZ SCAGGS HITS
Lido missed the boat that day
He left the shack
But that was all he missed
And he ain't comin' back
At a tombstone bar
In a juke joint car
He made a stop
Just long enough
To grab a handle off the top
Next stop Chi town
Lido put the money down
Let 'em roll
He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One for the road
