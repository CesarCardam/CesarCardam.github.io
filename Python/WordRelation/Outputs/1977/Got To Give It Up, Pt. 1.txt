20. Marvin Gayealbum
I used to go out to parties
And stand around
'Cause I was too nervous
To really get down
But my body yearned to be free
I got up on the floor and found
Someone to choose me
No more standin' along the side walls
Now I've got myself together, baby
And I'm havin' a ball
Long as you prove it
There's always a chance
Somebody watches
Might wanna make romance
Move your body, ooo baby, you dance all night
To the groove and feel all right
Everybody's groovin' on like a fool
But if you see me, top down, let me in
Baby just party high and low
Let me step into your erotic zone
Move it up
Turn it 'round
Ooo shake it down
Owwww
You can love me when you want to babe
This is such a groovy party baby
We're here face to face
Everybody's swingin'
This is such a groovy place
All the young ladies are so fine!
You're movin your body easy with no doubts
I know what you thinkin' baby
You wanna turn me out
Think I'm gonna let you do it babe
Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin'
You got to get it
Got to give it up
Keep on dancin'
Got to give it up
