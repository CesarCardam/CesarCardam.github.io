Don't leave me this way
I can't survive
I can't stay alive
Without you love, oh baby
Don't leave me this way, no
I can't exist
I'll surely miss
Your tender kiss
Don't leave me this way
Baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
Now come on down and do what you've gotta do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burnin', outta control
Come and satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good lovin' can set me free
Don't, don't ya leave me this way, no
Don't ya understand
I'm at your command
Oh baby, please
Please, don''t leave me this way
No, baby
Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love
Baby, don't leave me this way
Baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've gotta do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burnin', outta control
So Come and satisfy the need in me
Only your good lovin' can set me free
Need your lovin' baby
Need
Need
Satisfy the need in me
Satisfy the need in me...
Hay, Hay Baby
Come satisfy the need in me
Oh, oh, baby
Come satisfy the need in me
Oh, baby
Don't leave me this way
Don't leave me this way
