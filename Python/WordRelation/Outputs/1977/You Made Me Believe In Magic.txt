76. Bay City Rollersalbum
I believed all love had gone
Had no strength to carry on
Thought my world was upside down
The day you walked into my life
Went to work to set things right
What's the secret that you used?
Oh you made me believe in magic
The moment I gazed into your eyes
Well you made me believe in magic
Your love brought magic to my life
Now I'm filled with a new sense to be
You gave my life harmony
Love and you are all I, all I need,
Oh you made me believe in magic
The moment I gazed into your eyes
Well you made me believe in magic
Your love brought magic to my life
Stay until our lives have to end
To leave would be such a sin
Girl you are my ev'ry, ev'rything
Oh you made me believe in magic
The moment I gazed into your eyes
Well you made me believe in magic
Your love brought magic to my life
Oh you, made me believe in magic
The moment I gazed into your eyes
Well you made me believe in magic
Your love brought magic to my life
