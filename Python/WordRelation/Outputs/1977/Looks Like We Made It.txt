There you are, lookin' just the same as you did last time I touched you
And here I am, close to gettin' tangled up inside the thought of you
Do you love him as much as I love her?
And will that love be strong when old feelings start to stir?
Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it
Love's so strange, playin' hide and seek with hearts and always hurtin'
We're the fools standin' close enough to touch those burnin' memories
And if I hold you for the sake of all those times love made us lose our minds
Could I ever let you go?
Whoa, no, we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it
Oh, we made it
Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it
Looks like we made it
Oh babe we made it
