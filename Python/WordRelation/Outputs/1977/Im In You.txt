42. Peter FramptonBest Of
I don't care where I go when I'm with you
When I cry you don't laugh cause you know me
I'm in you
You're in me
You gave me the love, the love that I never had
You and I don't pretend; we make love
I can't feel anymore than I'm singing
I'm in you
You're in me
You gave me the love, the love that I never had
Come so far when you think
you think back
You can't buy what we made, you and I
I'm in you
You're in me
You gave me the love, the love that I never had
