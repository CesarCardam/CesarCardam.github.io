66. Ronnie Milsapalbum
Once in every life
Someone comes along
And you came to me
It was almost like a song
You were in my arms
Right where you belong
And we were so in love
It was almost like a song
January through December
We had such a perfect year
Then the flame became a dying ember
All at once you weren't here
Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night
And It's almost like a song
But it's much too sad to write
Now my broken heart
Cries for you each night
And It's almost like a song
But it's much too sad to write
It's too sad to write
