35. Natalie ColeNatalie Cole - Inseparable/Natalie/Unpredictable
I've got love on my mind
I've got love on my mind
I've got love on my mind
And there's nothing particular wrong
It's a feeling I feel inside
When I woke up early this morning
It was staring me straight in my eye
I've got love on my mind
I've got love on my mind
I've got love on my mind
When you touch me I can't resist
And you've touched me a thousand times
When I think of your tender kiss
Then and there I start to unwind
In your arms I like to be
Caressing you gently and passionately
From sunrise to sunset and all through the day
I've been waiting for your return
And you know this is where I'll be
I can say to the world I learned
Only you can satisfy me, satisfy me
You have made me so happy, happy
(Love) love, love on my my my mind
(Love) love, love on my mind
(Love) love, love on my mind
(Love) love on my mind
(Love, love)
(Love, love)
(Love, love)
(Love)
Love on my mind
Love on my mind
Love on my mind
Love on my mind
Love on my mind
Love on my mind
