54. Brothers JohnsonRight on Time
Hello, my love
I heard a kiss from you
Red magic satin playing near, too
All through the morning rain
I gaze - the sun doesn't shine -
Rainbows and waterfalls run through my mind
In the garden - I see west
Purple shower, bells and tea
Orange birds and river cousins dressed in green
Pretty music I hear - so happy
And loud - blue flower echo
From a cherry cloud
Feel sunshine sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh
if you try to ask
Is it cool?, is it cool?
If you arrive and don't see me
I'm going to be with my baby
I am free - flying in her arms, over the sea
Stained window, yellow candy screen
See speakers of kite - with velvet roses diggin' freedom flight
A present from you - Strawberry letter 22
The music plays, I sit in for a few
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...
A present from you - Strawberry letter 22
The music plays, I sit in for a few
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...
