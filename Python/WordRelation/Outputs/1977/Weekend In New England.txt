65. Barry ManilowUltimate Manilow
Last night I waved goodbye,
Now it seems years
I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you,
Bringing us near
And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again
Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait
And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again
I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out
All the love that I have
With you there's a heaven,
So earth ain't so bad
And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you
Again
Again
