87. Rose Roycealbum
Sittin' here in this chair waitin' on you
Oh, baby, to see things my way
But not a word do you say
You won't even look my way
Girl I'm spendin' my dimes, wastin' my time
Talkin' till I'm black and blue
Uh, can't you see
I want to get next to you
Dreams of you and I go sailing by
Whenever your eyes meet mine (You're so fine)
And, girl, you make me feel so insecure
You're so beautiful and pure
Why must you be unkind and tell me I'm not your kind, blowin my mind
Girl, my, my money is low and I know
That I can't take you to the fancy places you might want to go
Still I want to get next to you
I, I want to get next to you
Baby, yeah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, yeah
Girl, you can bend me, shake me, make me
Whatever it takes to please you, I'm willing to do
'Cause you're my dream come true
And I want to get next to you, baby, yea
I want to get next to you (I want to make you mine for all the time)
I want to get next to you (I promise I'll never make you blue)
I want to get next to you (So when love begins between me and you)
I want to get next to you (Girl, I'm in love)
I want to get next to you
