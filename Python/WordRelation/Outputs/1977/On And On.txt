30. Stephen Bishopalbum
On and on
Stephen Bishop
Down in Jamaica
They go lots of pretty women
Steal your money
Then they break your heart
Lonesome sue, she's in love with ol'Sam
Take him from the fire into the frying pan
On and on
She just keeps on trying
And she smiles when she feels like crying
On and on, On and on, On and on
Poor ol'Jimmy
Sits alone in the moonlight
Saw his woman kiss another man
So he takes a ladder
Steals the stars from the sky
Puts on sinatra and starts to cry
On and on
He just keeps on trying
And he smiles when he feels like crying
On and on, On and on, On and on
when the first time is the last time
It can make you feel so bad
But if you know it, show it
Hold on tight
Don't let her say: Goodnight
Got the sun on my shoulders
And my toes in the sand
My woman's left me for the some other man
Aw, but I don't care
I'll just dream and stay tan
Toos up my heart to see where it lands
On and on
I just keep on trying
And I smile when I feel like dying
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
On and on
