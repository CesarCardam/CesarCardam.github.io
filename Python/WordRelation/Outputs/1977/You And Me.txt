When I get home from work,
I want to wrap myself around you.
I want to take you and squeeze you
till the passion starts to rise.
I want to take you to heaven.
That would make my day complete.
But you and me ain't no movie stars.
What we are is what we are.
We share a bed,
some lovin',
and TV, yeah.
And that's enough for a workin' man.
What I am is what I am.
And I tell you, babe,
well that's enough for me.
Sometimes when you're asleep
and I'm just starin' at the ceiling,
I want to reach out and touch you,
but you just go on dreamin'.
If I could take you to heaven,
that would make my day complete.
But you and me ain't no movie stars.
What we are is what we are.
We share a bed,
some lovin',
and TV, yeah.
That's enough for a workin' man.
What I am is what I am.
And I tell you, sweetheart
that's just enough for me.
You and me ain't no super stars.
What we are is what we are.
We share a bed,
some popcorn,
and TV, yeah.
And that's enough for a workin' man.
What I am is what I am.
And I tell you, babe,
you're just enough for me.
When I get home from work,
I want to wrap myself around you.
I like to hold you squeeze you
till the passion starts to rise.
I want to take you to heaven.
That would make my day complete.
You and me ain't no movie stars.
What we are is what we are.
We share a bed,
of lovin',
and TV, yeah.
And that's enough for a workin' man.
What I am well that's what I am.
I tell you, baby,
that's just enough for me.
