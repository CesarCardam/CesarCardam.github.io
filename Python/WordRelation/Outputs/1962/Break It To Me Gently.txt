26. Brenda Lee20th Century Masters: The Best Of Brenda Lee (Millenium Collection)
Break it to me gently,
Let me down the easy way
Make me feel you still love me
If it's just, if it's just for one more day
Break it to me gently
So my tears, my tears won't fall too fast
If you must go, then go slowly,
Let me love you 'till the last
The love we shared, for oh so long
Is such a big part of me
If you must take your love away,
Take it gradually
Oh, oh, break it, break it to me gently,
Give me time, oh give me a little time to ease the pain
Love me just a little longer,
'Cause I'll never never love again
'Cause I'll never love again
