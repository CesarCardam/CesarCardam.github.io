(Party lights, I see the party lights)
Whoa
(They're red and blue and green)
Lights
(Everybody in the crowd's there)
Mama, I want to go, go, go, go, go, go, yeah, yeah
Well, mama dear, tell me, do you hear?
We're partying tonight
I tell you, I can't sleep
Because across the street
Whoa, oh, I see the party lights
[Chorus]
I see the lights, I see the party lights
They're red and blue and green
Everybody in the crowd's there
But you won't let me make a scene
Well, mama dear, look here, oh dear
There goes Mary Lou
I see Tommy and Joe, oh, oh, and Betty Sue
Oh, oh, and there goes my boyfriend too
I see the lights
[Chorus]
Listen to the party, mama!
Well, mama dear, look here, oh dear
I'm feeling oh-so blue
They're doin' the twist, the fish, the mashed potatoes too
I fear I'm lookin' at you
I see the lights
[Chorus]
They're doin' the fish, they're doin' the twist
The Watusi, the mashed potatoes
I see the lights, I see the lights
They're doin' the bop, I want to go
