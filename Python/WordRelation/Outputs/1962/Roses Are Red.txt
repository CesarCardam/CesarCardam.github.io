(Roses are red, my love, doo-doo-da-doo)
A long, long time ago
On graduation day
You handed me your book
I signed this way
"Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you"
We dated through high school
And when the big day came
I wrote into your book
Next to my name
"Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you" (as sweet as you)
Then I went far away
And you found someone new
I read your letter, dear
And I wrote back to you
"Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
Good luck, may god bless you" (may god bless you)
Is that your little girl?
She looks a lot like you
Someday some boy will write
In her book, too
"Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you" (roses are red)
