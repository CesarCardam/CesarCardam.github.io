Sweet little Sheila, you'll know her if you see her
Blue eyes and a ponytail
Her cheeks are rosy, she looks a little nosy
Man, this little girl is fine
Never knew a girl like-a little Sheila
Her name drives me insane
Sweet little girl, that's my little Sheila
Man, this little girl is fine
Me and Sheila go for a ride
Oh oh oh oh, I feel all funny inside
Then little Sheila whispers in my ear
Oh oh oh oh, I love you Sheila dear
Sheila said she loved me, she said she'd never leave me
True love will never die
We're so doggone happy just bein' around together
Man, this little girl is fine
Never knew a girl like-a little Sheila
Her name drives me insane
Sweet little girl, that's my little Sheila
Man, this little girl is fine
Me and Sheila go for a ride
Oh oh oh oh, I feel all funny inside
Then little Sheila whispers in my ear
Oh oh oh oh, I love you Sheila dear
Sheila said she loved me, she said she'd never leave me
True love will never die
We're so doggone happy just bein' around together
Man, this little girl is fine
Oh, this little girl is fine
Yeah, this little girl is fine
Oh, this little girl is fine
