Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learning how
Come on and safari with me
(Come on and safari with)
Early in the morning we'll be startin' out
Some honeys will be coming along
We're loading up our woody
With our boards inside
And headin' out singing our song
Come on (surfin') baby wait and see (surfin' safari)
Yes I'm gonna (surfin') take you surfin' (surfin' safari) with me
Come along (surfin') baby wait and see (surfin' safari)
Yes I'm gonna (surfin') take you surfin' (surfin' safari) with me
Let's go surfin' now
Everybody's learning how
Come on and safari with me
(Come on and safari with)
At huntington and malibu
They're shooting the pier
At rincon they're walking the nose
We're going on safari to the islands this year
So if you're coming get ready to go
Come on (surfin') baby wait and see (surfin' safari)
Yes I'm gonna (surfin') take you surfin' (surfin' safari) with me
Come along (surfin') baby wait and see (surfin' safari)
Yes I'm gonna (surfin') take you surfin' (surfin' safari) with me

They're anglin' in laguna in Cerro Azul
They're kicking out in dohini too
I tell you surfing's mighty wild
It's getting bigger every day
From Hawaii to the shores of Peru
Come on (surfin') baby wait and see (surfin' safari)
Yes I'm gonna (surfin') take you surfin' (surfin' safari) with me
Come along (surfin') baby wait and see (surfin' safari)
Yes I'm gonna (surfin') take you surfin' (surfin' safari) with me
