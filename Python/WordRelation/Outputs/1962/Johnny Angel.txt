You're an Angel to me.
Johnny Angel, how I love him.
He's got something I can't resist,
but he doesn't even know that I exist.
Johnny Angel, how I want him.
How I tingle when he passes by.
Every time he says "Hello" my heart begins to fly.
I remember how I get carried away.
I dream of him and me, and how it's gonna be.
Other fellas call me up for a date,
but I just sit and wait, I'd rather concentrate ...
... on Johnny Angel.
'Cause I love him.
And I pray that someday he'll love me.
And together we will see how lovely heaven will be.
