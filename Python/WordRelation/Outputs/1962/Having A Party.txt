52. Sam CookePortrait of a Legend 1951-1964 (Remastered)
We're havin' a party
Dancin' to the music
Played by the DJ
On the radio
The Coke's out in the icebox
Popcorn's on the table
Me and my baby
We're out here on the floor
So Mr, Mr. DJ
Keep those records playin'
'Cause I'm a-havin' such a good time
Dancin' with my baby
Everybody's swingin'
Sally's doin' the twist now
If you take requests I've
Got a few for you
Play that song called soul twist
Play that one called I know
Don't forget the mashed potatoes
No other songs will do
Let me tell you Mr, Mr. DJ
Keep those records playin'
'Cause I'm a-havin' such a good time
Dancin' with my baby
We're havin' a party, yeah
Everybody's swingin', oh yeah
Dancin' to the music, yeah
On the radio
Oh, we're havin' a party
Everybody's swingin'
Dancin' to the music, yeah
On the radio
One more time
We're havin' a party, yeah
And everybody's swingin'
Oh we're dancin' to the music, yeah
On the radio
