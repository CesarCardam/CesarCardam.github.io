28. Nat King ColeThe World Of Nat King Cole
Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why you ramble, no one knows
Wild and wind blown, that's how you've grown
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?
Ramble on, ramble on
When your ramblin' days are gone
Who will love you with a love true
When your ramblin' days are gone?
Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why I want you, heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?
Ramblin' rose, ramblin' rose
Why I want you, heaven knows
Though I love you with a love true
Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?
