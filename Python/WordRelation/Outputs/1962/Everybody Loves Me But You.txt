73. Brenda Lee20th Century Masters: The Best Of Brenda Lee (Millenium Collection)
Why did I listen to my friends
When they told me what to do
Yes, I still have my friends
But I don't have you
And like true friends
They still come around
And say, I'm sorry you're blue
Whoa, everybody loves me but you
My friends don't know what they've done
Well, they wouldn't understand anyhow
I can't tell them they were wrong
'Cause I'm afraid they'll leave me, too
Now, it's funny but more than ever
I need them now
I still ask my friends what to do
But it seems they don't know how to bring
How to bring you back
They say, what made him go
