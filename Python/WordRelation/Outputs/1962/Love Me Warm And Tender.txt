76. Paul AnkaThe Real...
Love me warm and tender, dear
Love me warm like the glow of the morning sun
Love me warm and tender, dear
Love me so just as though I'm the o-o-o-onl-why-why one
Kiss me warm and tender, dear
Kiss me strong, kiss me long 'til the end of time
Kiss me warm and tender, dear
Let me know, tell me so 'til the end of time
I'm in heaven in-a your embrace
See the glow of your angel face
Heaven sings, heaven rings, on your wings we will fly away
We will fly, you and I, to the sky where we'll always stay
Love me warm and tender, dear
Take my lips, take my arms, they belong to you
Love me warm and tender, dear
I'm a part of your heart for my whole life through
