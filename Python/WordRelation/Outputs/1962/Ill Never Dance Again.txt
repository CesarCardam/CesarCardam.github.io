93. Bobby Rydellalbum
My soul was a swaying to the beat of your heart
And your lips were saying that we won't dance apart
Now someone else is holding you the way I did the-eh-eh
So I'll never, no I'll never, never dance again, whoa oh no
Oh I've danced with others just to show I don't care
But my arms discovered that the thrill wasn't there
Unless my arms are holding you the way I did the-eh-eh eh-en
So I'll never, no I'll never, never dance again whoa oh no
I'll stay off the dance floor till memories grow d-i-i-m
Cause my heart would break to see you take every step with him
I'll survive seeing ya sighing on that shoulder of his
Oh how I've been crying knowing how sweet that is
So while that guy is holding you the way I did the-eh-eh eh-en
I will never, no no I'll never never dance again oh I'll never
