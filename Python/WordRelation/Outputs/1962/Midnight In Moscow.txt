21. Kenny BallThe Essential Recordings
Stillness in the grove
Not a rustling sound
Softly shines the moon clear and bright
Dear, if you could know
How I treasure so
This most beautiful Moscow Night
Lazily the brook like a silvery stream
Ripples in the light of the moon
And a song afar fades as in a dream
In this night that will end too soon
Yes a song afar fades as in a dream
In this night that will end too soon
Dearest, why so sad, why the downcast eyes
And your lovely head bent so low
Oh, I mustn't speak, though I'd love to say
That you've stolen my heart away
Promise me my love, as the dawn appears
And the darkness turns into light
That you'll cherish dear, through the passing years
This most beautiful Moscow Night
Say you'll cherish dear through the passing years
This most beautiful Moscow Night
