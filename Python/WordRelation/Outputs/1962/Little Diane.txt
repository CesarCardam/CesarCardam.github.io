86. DionAlone with Dion/Lovers Who Wander
Diane...Down deep inside I cry
Diane...Without your love I'd die
Diane...You know you drive me wild...Diane
You're such a little evil child ya ya ya
Ya, I wanna pack and leave and slap your face
Bad girls like you are a disgrace
A way down deep inside I cry
Without you little Diane I'd die
I should drag you down 'cause you're no good
You're two-faced, your heart's made of wood
A way down deep inside I cry
Without you little Diane I'd die
Listen to my heart
Oh you're tearin' it apart
Oh why don't you understand
Why don't you stop it! stop it!
Stop it if you can
I want to spread the news that you're untrue
But Diane what good would it do
'Cause way down deep inside I cry
Without you little Diane I'd die, I'd die
Ya! Don't you understand Diane
I said ya, ya, ya
I said listen to the beat
Oh I feel it in my feet
Now it's my heart Diane
Why don't you stop it! stop it!
Stop it if you can
I want to spread the news that you're untrue
But Diane what good would it do
'Cause way down deep inside I cry
Without you little Diane I'd die, I'd die
Oh yeah
