70. Mary WellsLive on Stage
One day I first saw you on passing by,
I wanted to know your name but I was much too shy.
I was looking at you so hard until you must have had a hunch,
So you came up to me and asked me my name.
You Beat Me To The Punch, that time,
You Beat Me To The Punch. Oh!
You Beat Me To The Punch, Yeah!
Oh! After I had known you for, it seems, for long, long time,
I wanted to ask you would you please be mine.
When ever you came around, my heart would pound,
so you must have had a hunch,
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours.
You Beat Me To The Punch, that time,
You Beat Me To The Punch. Oh!
You Beat Me To The Punch, Yeah!
Since I loved you, I thought you would be true and love me tender,
So I let my heart surrender to you, yes I did
But I found out beyond a doubt, one day, boy,
you were a play boy who would go away and leave me blue.
So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down.
This time I'm gonna play my hunch, and walk away this very day,
And Beat You To The Punch this time,
And Beat You To The Punch,
And Beat You To The Punch, Yeah!
And Beat You To The Punch, Yeah!
