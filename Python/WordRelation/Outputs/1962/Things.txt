62. Bobby DarinDefinitive Pop: Bobby Darin
Ev'ry night I sit here by my window (window)
Starin' at the lonely avenue (avenue)
Watching lovers holdin' hands 'n' laughin' (laughin')
And thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
(Thinkin' of things) like a walk in the park
(Things) like a kiss in the dark
(Things) like a sailboat ride (yeah-yeah)
What about the night we cried?
Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
Memories are all I have to cling to (cling to)
And heartaches are the friends I'm talkin' to (talkin' to)
When I'm not thinkin' of-a just how much I loved you (love you)
Well, I'm-a thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
(Thinkin' of things) like a walk in the park
(Things) like a kiss in the dark
(Things) like a sailboat ride (yeah-yeah)
What about the night we cried?
Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
I still can hear the jukebox softly playin' (playin')
And the face I see each day belongs to you (belongs to you)
Though there's not a single sound and there's nobody else around
Well, it's just me thinkin' of the things we used to do
(Thinkin' of things) like a walk in the park
(Things) like a kiss in the dark
(Things) like a sailboat ride (yeah-yeah)
What about the night we cried?
Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
And the heartaches are the friends I'm talkin' to
Ya got me thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do
Starin' at the lonely avenue
