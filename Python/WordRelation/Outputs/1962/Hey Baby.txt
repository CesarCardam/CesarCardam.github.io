Hey, hey hey baby
I want to know if you'll be my girl
Hey, hey hey baby
I want to know if you'll be my girl
When I saw you walking down the street
I said that's a kind of girl I'd like to meet
She's so pretty, Lord she's fine
I'm gonna make her mine all mine
Hey, hey hey baby
I want to know if you'll be my girl
When you turned and walked away
That's when I want to say
C'mon baby, give me a whirl
I want to know if you'll be my girl
Hey, hey hey baby
I want to know if you'll be my girl
When you turned and walked away
That's when I want to say
C'mon baby, give me a whirl
I want to know if you'll be my girl
Hey, hey hey baby
I want to know if you'll be my girl
Hey, hey hey hey hey, baby c'mon, baby now
