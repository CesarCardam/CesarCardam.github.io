You want somethin' done?
You gotta do it yourself
OW!
y'all think this is gonna be another one of those funky joints
Heart, soul, d-d-dance!
If I was you, and you were me, you ought a be winning
If you want something better, you gotta want to keep your all
'Cause I believe, so much do we, they know we're not kidding
If you feel the same as me, girl, you gotta learn to take the fall
Now I find out that nothing is given
Don't know where the cards may fall
All I know is that we gotta get it
We've gotta make it on our own
Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
(on our own)
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home
(on our own)
Can't you see that all we need to be a go-getter
Gotta make your own decisions, gotta go for what ya know
There comes a time in our lives, you want to be bigger
Gotta keep, keep on pushing, you gotta learn to take control, yeah
Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
(on our own)
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home
Gotta, gotta, take it home, gotta, gotta, gotta take it home (on our own)
Heart, soul, d-d-dance!
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
They're called Ghostbusters and they're in control
Had 'em throwin' a party for a bunch of children
While all the while, the slime was under the building
So they packed up the crew, got a grip came quick
Grabbed the proton packs on their backs, and they split
To battle out Vigo, the master of evil
Try to battle my boys? That's not legal
(Oh-we-oh) They're in control
(Oh-we-oh) why-why-Ya know it
I said they're in control
(Oh-we-oh) why-why-Ya know it
(Oh-we-oh) why-why-Ya know it
Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
Gotta, gotta, gotta...gotta, gotta, gotta (on our own)
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold, they're called Ghostbusters and they're in control
(on our own)
Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
Gotta, gotta, take it home, gotta, gotta take it home (on our own)
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home
Gotta, gotta, take it home, gotta, gotta, gotta take it home (on our own)
(Oh-we-oh) OW!
(Oh-we-oh) why-why-Ya know it
(Oh-we-oh) Uh!
(Oh-we-oh) why-why-Ya know it
Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
