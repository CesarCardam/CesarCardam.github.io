Keep on movin'
Don't stop like the hands of time
Click clock, find your own way to stay
The time will come one day
Why do people
Choose to live their lives this way?
Keep on movin', don't stop, no
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin', don't stop no
Keep on movin'
It's our time, time today
The right time is here to stay
Stay in my life, my life always
Yellow is the color of sun rays
I hide myself from no one
I know the time will surely come when
You'll be in my life, my life always
Yellow is the color of sun rays
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin', don't stop no
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
The time will come one day
Keep on movin', don't stop no
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin', don't stop no
Keep on movin'
I know the time, time today
Walking alone in my own way
Extremely cold and rainy day
Friends and I have fun along the way, yes we do
I hide myself from no one
I know the time will really come when
You'll be in my life, my life always
Yellow is the color of sun rays
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin', don't stop no
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
The time will come one day
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin', don't stop no
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
The time will come one day
Keep on movin'
Don't stop like the hands of time
Click clock, find your own way to stay
The time will come one day
Why do people
Choose to live their lives this way?
Oh why do they choose to live this way?
Keep on movin', don't stop, no
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin', don't stop no
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin', don't stop no
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
The time will come one day
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin', don't stop no
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
The time will come one day
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin', don't stop no
Keep on movin'
Keep on movin'
The time will come one day
