38. Taylor Daynealbum
Red roses, temptation,
You make the most of a ify situation
I'm weighing my decision
Who's to say if it's love,or if it isn't?
Only time will tell
Just how well I'll get to know you
Don't mean to lead you on,
But I want to take it slowly, slowly
Don't rush me
I've made that mistake before, ah
Don't rush me
This love could be so much more
It's well worth the waiting for
Desire can mean danger,
I want to lover, not another stranger
I'm saving all my passion
Who's to say if its love, or just attraction?
Only time will tell
Just how well I'll get to know you
Don't mean to lead you on
But I want to take it slowly, slowly
And my resistance is weakening, weakening every time we touch
Baby, you get everything, everything that I've been dreamin' of
Don't rush me
I've made that mistake before, oh yeah
Don't rush me. This love could be so much more,
It's well worth the waiting for, yeah
My resistance is weakening
Every time we touch,
'Cause baby you've got everything,
Everything That I've been dreaming of
Don't rush me
I've made that mistake before,
Oh yeah. Don't rush me. This love could be so much more,
It's well worth the waiting for
Don't rush me
I've made that mistake before,
Oh yeah. Don't rush me. This love could be so much more,
It's well worth the waiting for, yeah
