35. CherHeart Of Stone
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
And you'd stay
I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Love's like a knife it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't want to see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time
My world was shattered I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife and drove it
Deep in my heart
You walk out that door I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything darling then and there
Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind, and darling
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do, oh
If I could turn back time (If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time (If I could turn back time)
If I could turn back time, oh baby
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't want to see you go
I know I made you cry
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time (turn back time)
If I could find a way (find a way)
Then maybe maybe maybe you'd stay
