82. Bon JoviThis Left Feels Right: Greatest Hits With A Twist
(Hey)
They say that to really free your body
You've got to free your mind
So come on
(Hey, hey, hey)
Check this out (hey)
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me
Come on
If you're ready, I'm willing and able
Help me lay my cards out on the table
You're mine and I'm yours for the taking
Right now the rules we've made are meant for breaking
What you get ain't always what you see
But satisfaction is guaranteed
They say what you give is always what you need, whoa whoa
If you want me to lay my hands on you
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me
All you gotta do is
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me
Now listen up
I'm a fighter, I'm a poet, I'm a preacher
I've been to school and baby I've been the teacher
If you show me how to get up off the ground
I can show you how to fly and never ever come back down
Everything you want is what I need
Your satisfaction is, uh, guaranteed
But the ride don't never ever come for free, no oh oh
If you want me to lay my hands on you
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me
All you gotta do is
Lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me, lay your hands on me
Now now now baby
Don't you know I only aim to please?
If you want me to lay my hands on you, whoa whoa whoa
(What you gotta do is)
Lay your hands on me (lay on me)
Lay your hands on me (come on, come on, come on)
Lay your hands on me
(Everybody gonna help me now)
Lay your hands on me (I can feel the people sing)
Lay your hands on me (I can feel my heart sing)
Lay your hands on me (if you wanna lay them on baby, come on now)
Whoa oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh oh, lay your hands on me (if you want me to)
Whoa oh oh oh oh (all you got do) whoa oh oh oh oh, lay your hands on me
Remember (lay your hands on me)
Well, move it on (lay your hands on me)
Oh, turn around, yeah (lay your hands on me)
Lay (lay your hands on me)
(Lay your hands on me)
Lay your hands on me
