Baby
B-B-B-Baby
Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this
Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real
You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down
Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real
Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own
Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey
Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself
