53. Def LeppardVault: Def Leppard&#039;s Greatest Hits
You better come inside when you're ready to
But no chance if ya don't want to dance
You're like four-letter words when you're ready to
But then you won't 'cause you know that you can
You got it, but are you gettin' it?
You say that love is won when you get some
But then your finger won't trigger the gun
You know you can't stop it, so don't rock it, you know you got it
Hey, but are you gettin' it?
Really gettin' it, come get it from me
(Gimme all of your lovin')
Every little bit (gimme all that you got)
Every bit of it (every bit of your lovin')
Oh, c'mon live a bit (never want it to stop)
Yeah, but are you gettin' it? (armageddon it)
Ooh, really gettin' it? (yes, armageddon it)
Yeah, doo-doo wop
You try comin' on when you need some
But then you don't 'cause you already did
Yeah, you jangle your jewels while your shakin' ya
And drive the pretty boys outta their heads
You got it, but are you gettin' it?
You flash you bedroom eyes like a jumpin' jack
Then play it pretty with a pat on the back
You know you can't stop it, so don't rock it
You know you got it
Hey, but are you gettin' it?
Ooh, really gettin' it, oh, come get it from me
(Gimme all of your lovin')
Every little bit (gimme all that you got)
Every bit of it (every bit of your lovin')
Oh, c'mon live a bit (never want it to stop)
Yeah, but are you gettin' it? (armageddon it)
Ooh, really gettin' it? (yes, armageddon it)
C'mon, Steve, get it
Take it, take it, take it from me
I got an itchy finger following me
Pull it, pull it, c'mon trigger the gun
'Cause the best is yet to come, I say
'Cause the best is yet to come
Are you gettin' it? Really gettin' it?
Are you getting it, really getting it?
Oh, come get it from me
(Gimme all of your lovin')
Every little bit (gimme all that you got)
Every bit of it (every bit of your lovin')
Oh, c'mon live a bit (never want it to stop)
(Gimme all of your lovin')
Oh, are you getting it? (gimme all that you got)
Oh, are you getting it? (every bit of your lovin')
Oh, little bit (gimme all that you got)
Little bit
You got to live it (gimme all of your lovin')
Oh, baby, mean it (gimme all that you got)
Come on and give it (gimme all of your lovin')
Oh, come on and give it (never want it to stop)
Oh, are you getting it? (gimme all of your lovin')
Ooh, are you getting it? (never want it to stop)
Oh, are you getting it (every bit of your lovin')
