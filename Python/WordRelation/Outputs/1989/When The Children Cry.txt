The little girl standing in the rain on the corner of
42nd street and she's all alone on the bad side of town cause
there was a little boy that she loved with all her heart but
he's far away with another girl now she's searching for a
friend just to hold her when she cries in her lonely nights,
lonely nights where no one seems to care in her lonely nights,
lonely nights you better beware but baby you try and you try
but it seems that it doesn't work cause love is a game that
they play so baby hold on to your heart when they tell you
that they care yeah now that you know that the winner takes
what he wants but she's searching for a friend just hold her
when she cries in her lonely nights, lonely nights where no
one seems to care in her lonely nights, lonely nights you
better beware and somewhere in the night there's a little cry
a girl who says hey I wanna die there's no one here who cares
but if there's someone here who understands just someone here
who'll try to lend a hand and bring her home tonight, tonight
in her lonely nights, etc...
