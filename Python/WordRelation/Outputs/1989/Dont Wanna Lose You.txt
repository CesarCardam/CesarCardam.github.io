14. Gloria EstefanGloria Estefan - Greatest Hits
Sometimes it's hard to make things clear
Or know when you face the truth
And I know that the moment is here
I'll open my heart and show you inside
My love has no pride
I feel with you I've got nothing to hide
So open your eyes and see who I am
And not who you want for me to be
I am only myself, myself
I don't want to loose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't want to loose you now or ever
'Cause baby I've finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me
I'll be around, forever
We all make mistakes, we all loose our way
But we stood the test of time and I hope
That's the way it will stay
It's all up to you, to tell me to go
'Cause it won't be me to walk away
When your all that I know
And I know
That I don't want to loose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't want to loose you now or ever, never
'Cause baby I've finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me
I'll be around forever, forever
I don't want to loose you, loose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't want to loose you now
I don't want to loose you
Don't want to loose you
