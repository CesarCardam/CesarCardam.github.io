18. Fine Young CannibalsThe Raw &amp; The Cooked
I can't stop the way I feel
Things you do don't seem real
Tell me what you've got in mind
'Cause we're running out of time
Won't you ever set me free?
This waiting 'round's killing me
She drives me crazy like no one else
She drive me crazy and I can't help myself
I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me that's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong, they always do
She drives me crazy like no one else
She drive me crazy and I can't help myself
I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be a lone
She drives me crazy like no one else
She drive me crazy, and I can't help myself
She drives me crazy like no one else
She drive me crazy, and I can't help myself
She drives me crazy like no one else
She drive me crazy, and I can't help myself
