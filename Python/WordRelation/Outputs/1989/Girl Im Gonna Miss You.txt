16. Milli VanilliGirl You Know It&#039;s True
I knew it from the start
You would break my heart
But you still I had to play this painful part
You rapped me 'round your itty bitty finger
With your magic smile
You kept me hangin' on a lovers cross a while
You put your spell on me
Took my breath away
But there was nothin' I could do to make you stay
I'm gonna miss you
All the love I feel for you
Nothing could make me change my point of view
Oh girl
I'm gonna miss you baby
[Chorus]
Giving all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
Now I'm sittin' here, I'm wastin' my time
I just don't know what I should do
It's a tragedy for me
To see the dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl I'm gonna miss you
Like a honey bee
You took the best of me
Now I can't erase those memories
Like a fairy tale
You are so unreal
You left a scar that's so hard to heal
When you had a taste of paradise
Back on earth can feel
As cold as ice
I'm gonna miss you
I miss you
