Hey baby, you're drivin' me crazy,
with that special lovin' feelin' that you give to me...
And I'm so proud, you want me to be your lady,
now I know how it feels to live a fantasy...
I used to dream about love, and sure it's how it was,
but I don't have to dream no more!
'Cause I, I got more than I can stand, I found me a lover in another man,
I got you baby that's all I was waiting for...
And I love the way you love me, I place no one above, I don't want true love...
And I love the way you love me, and baby no matter what,
I love the, I love the way you love...
(oh-Oh! oh-Oh! oh-Oh! Oh-oh!, oh-Oh! oh-Oh!)
Oh baby, ba, baby, I might as well face it,
I've fallen in so deep, you have control of me...
Without a doubt, it has to be the greatest,
you are every bit the man I had hoped you'd be...
I used to dream about love, and sure it's how it was,
but I don't have to dream no more, oh no!
'Cause when I think about your lovin' then I got a good beat,
I get excited from the feeling that is given to me,
so won't you keep me comin' baby 'cause I love the joy you bring, oh I love...
And I love the way you love me, I place no one above, I don't want true love...
And I love the way you love me, and baby no matter what,
I love the, I love the way you love...
(oh-Oh! oh-Oh! oh-Oh! Oh-oh! oh-Oh! oh-Oh!)
I love the way you love...
(oh-Oh! oh-Oh! oh-Oh! Oh-oh! oh-Oh! oh-Oh!)I love the way...
One, for all the special love,
two, a sensitive and tender touch,
three, because you please, you bring out the best in me,
'cause when I think about your lovin' then I got a good beat,
I get excited from the feelin' that is given to me,
so won't you keep me comin' baby 'cause I love the joy you bring, oh I love...
(oh Oh! oh Oh! oh Oh! Oh oh! oh Oh! oh Oh!)

And I love the way you love me, I place no one above, I don't want true love...
And I love the way you love me, and baby no matter what,
I love the, I love the way you love...
One, for all the special love,
two, a sensitive and tender touch,
