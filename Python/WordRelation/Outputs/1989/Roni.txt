80. Bobby BrownDon&#039;t Be Cruel
The truth about a roni, she's a sweet little girl
You can treat her right, feel nice, and hold her tight
Only tenderonies can give a special love
A special kind of love that makes ya feel good inside
If you believe in love and all that it can do for you
Give it a chance, girl, you'll find romance
And if you find a tenderoni that is right for you
Make it official, give her your love
My heart belongs to my roni (she's my only love)
She's my only love
My heart belongs to my roni (she's my only love)
She's my only love
The truth about a roni, she's always on the phone
Talking to her homeboy, wishin' they were home alone
She sends ya lovely letters, with the smell of sweet perfume
This is what a real tenderoni likes to do for you
If you believe in love and all that it can do for you
Give it a chance, girl, you'll find romance
And if you find a tenderoni that is right for you
Make it official, give her your love
My heart belongs to my roni (she's my only love)
She's my only love
My heart belongs to my roni (she's my only love)
She's my only love
The truth about a roni, she's a sweet ol' girl
About the sweetest little girl in the whole wide world
She'd make the toughest homeboy fall deep in love
And once you've had a roni, you never give her up
She's a special kind of girl that makes her daddy feel proud
You know, the kind of girl that stands out in crowds
If you found a tenderoni and a roni is so right
I think I'm gonna love her for the rest of my life
My heart belongs to my roni (she's my only love)
She's my only love
My heart belongs to my roni (she's my only love)
She's my only love
