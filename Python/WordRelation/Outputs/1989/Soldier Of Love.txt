57. Donny OsmondDefinitive Collection
So you heard that I'm a rebel with a heart made of stone.
I got a restless spririt that nobody can own.
If a picture tells a story won't you listen to mine,
I'm searching for the answer but it's so hard to find.
You'll see much deeper when you read between the lines,
'cause there's a fire burning in my eye.
Like a thief in the night, who can't get enough,
I am willing to fight,
'cause I'm a soldier of love.
Like a shot in the dark when the going gets rough,
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love.
I'm willing to fight.
Love can be so heartless when you turn out the lights,
A mutual surrender in the heat of the night.
Life's an empty picture when you're living alone,
Well, maybe that's the reason every heart needs a home.
Each time I fall down, I get on my feet again.
I'm gonna win this battle in the end.
Like a thief in the night, who can't get enough,
I am willing to fight,
'cause I'm a soldier of love.
Like a shot in the dark when the going gets rough,
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love.
You'll see much deeper when you read between the lines,
'cause there's a fire burning in my eye.
Like a thief in the night who can't get enough,
I am willing to fight,
'cause I'm a soldier of love.
Like a shot in the dark when the going gets rough,
It's a state of the heart
When you're a soldier of love.
Sha la la la la la la
When the going gets rough,
Sha la la la la la la
I'm a soldier of love.
