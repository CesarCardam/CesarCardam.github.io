03. PoisonPoison&#039;s Greatest Hits: 1986-1996
We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did
Did my words not come out right
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
But I guess that's why they say
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah it does
I listen to your favorite song
Playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder does he know
Has it ever felt like this
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could have let you know somehow I guess
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like the knife that cuts you the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains
I know I could have saved our love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead if making love
We both made our separate ways
Now he found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
I guess every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has it's dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
