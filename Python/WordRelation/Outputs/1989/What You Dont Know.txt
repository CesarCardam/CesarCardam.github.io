No is not an answer
One that I might try to understand you see
Love is only letters
Until you prove your love is here inside for me
Can you feel it
Or can't you see
I'll never love someone as much I know
What you see
It's what you'll get
Until I know it's real it won't change how I feel
What you don't know
Might hurt you
What you don't know
If you don't know
It won't hurt you
What you don't know
You, you play with fire
I know one day you're gonna be the one to burn
Love is like a game
What goes around comes around you wait your turn
It's a feeling
You change with time
We'll always be together wait and see
If you know me
That's what you'll get
Until I know it's real it won't change how I feel
What you don't know
Might hurt you
What you dot know
If you don't know
It won't hurt you
What you don't know
What you don't know, no never know
What you don't know, no never know
What you don't know, no never know
What you don't know, no never know
What you don't know
Might hurt you
What you dot know
If you don't know
It won't hurt you
What you don't know
