08. Milli VanilliGirl You Know It&#039;s True
"So what're you doing back?"
"Well, I sat back and thought about the things we used to do...
It really meant a lot to me. YOU mean a lot to me."
"I really mean that much to you?"
"Girl, you know it's true."
I'm in love with you, girl
Cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you pack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true
Your sophisticated hand knows how to sweeten things
That came like a brush up on your skin
It lightens up my day and that's oh so true
Together we're one, separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
Cause you contain a quality that I admire
You're pretty and simple, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love girl
I'm so in love girl
I'm just in love girl, and this is true
Girl you know it's true, oh, oh, oh
I love you
Yes you know it's true, oh, oh, oh
I love you
Girl you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl you know it's true
My love is for you
