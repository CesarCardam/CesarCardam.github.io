Shot like an arrow through my heart
That's the pain I feel
I feel whenever we're apart
Not to say that I'm in love with you
But who's to say that I'm not
I just know that it feels wrong when I'm away too long
It makes my body hot
So let me tell ya baby I'll tell your mama
I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone who's heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl who likes to be alone
I miss ya much I really miss you much
I miss ya much baby I really miss ya much
I'm rushing home just as soon as I can
I'm rushing home to see your smiling face
And feel your warm embrace
It makes me feel so g-g-g-good
So I'll tell ya baby I'll tell your mama
I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone who's heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl who likes to be alone
I miss ya much I really miss you much
I miss ya much baby I really miss ya much
I miss ya much I really miss you much
I miss ya much baby I really miss ya much
Miss you much
I miss you much
I really miss you much
Miss you much
I miss you much
I'll tell your mama
I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone who's heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl who likes to be alone
I miss ya much I really miss you much
I miss ya much baby I really miss ya much
I miss ya much I really miss you much
I miss ya much baby I really miss ya much
That's the end
