81. AerosmithA Little South Of Sanity (Live)
Workin' like a dog fo de boss man (oh)
Workin' for de company (oh yeah)
I'm bettin' on the dice I'm tossin' (oh)
I'm gonna have a fantasy (oh yeah)
But where am I gonna look?
They tell me that love is blind
I really need a girl like an open book
To read between the lines
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground
Jacki's in the elevator (oh)
Lingerie second floor (oh yeah)
She said can I see you later (oh)
And love you just a little more? (9oh yeah)
I kinda hope we get stuck
Nobody gets out alive
She said I'll show ya how to fax in the mail room
Honey and have you home by five
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up 'til I hit the ground
In the air, in the air, honey one more time not, it ain't fair
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an
Elevator
Goin' down
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up 'til I hit the ground
Gonna be a penthouse pauper (oh)
Gonna be a millionaire (oh yeah)
I'm gonna be a real fast talker (oh)
And have me a love affair (oh yeah)
Gotta get my timin' right (oh)
It's a test that I gotta pass (oh yeah)
I'll chase you all the way to the stairway honey (oh)
Kiss your sassafras
Love in an elevator
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up 'til I hit the ground
Do you care?
Do you care?
Honey one more time now it ain't fair
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
Do you care?
Do you care
Honey one more time now it ain't fair
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
In the air
In the air
Honey one more, one more, one more
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
In the air
In the air
Honey one more, one more, one more
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
In the air
In the air
Love in an elevator
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down
In the air
In the air
In the air
In the air
Love in an elevator
Living it up when I'm going down
