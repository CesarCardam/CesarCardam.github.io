The one good thing in my life
Has gone away
I don't know why
She's gone away
I don't know where
Somewhere I can't follow her
The one good thing didn't stay too long
Woo who who who
My back was turned and she was gone
Hey hey hey
Good thing
Where have you gone
Doo doo doobie doo
My good thing
You've been gone too long
Good thing
Doo doo doobie doo
People say I should forget
New friend tomorrow
Don't get upset
People say she's doing fine
Mutual friends I see sometime
That's not what I want to hear
Woo who who who
I want to hear she wants me near
Good thing
Where have you gone
Doo doo doobie doo
My good thing
You've been gone too long
Good thing
Doo doo doobie doo
Good thing
Then one day she came back
I was so happy that I didn't act
Morning came
Hey hey hey heyInto my room
Woo who who who
Caught me dreaming like a fool
Good thing
My good thing
Doo doo doobie doo
My my my my my good thing
Where have you gone
Good thing
Doo doo doobie doo
My good thing
Hey hey my good thing
Doo doo doobie doo good thing
Girl
Where have you gone
Good thing
Doo doo doobie doo good thing
It's been so long
Good God girl
Doo doo doobie doo good thing
Good God girl
Good God girl
Good thing
Doo doo doobie doo good thing
Good God
Doo doo doobie doo good thing
Good God
