49. New Kids On The BlockNew Kids On The Block - Greatest Hits
[Repeat: x2]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Listen up everybody if you want to take a chance
Just get on the floor and do the New Kids' dance
Don't worry 'bout nothing 'cause it won't take long
We're gonna put you in a trance with a funky song
'Cause you gotta be hangin' tough,
Hangin' tough, hangin' tough
We're rough
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Everybody's always talkin' 'bout who's on top
Don't cross our path 'cause you're gonna get stomped
We ain't gonna give anybody any slack
And if you try to keep us down we're gonna come right back
And you know we're hangin' tough,
Hangin' tough, hangin' tough
Are you tough enough, hangin' tough,
Hangin' tough, hangin' tough
We're rough
[Repeat: x2]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Get loose everybody 'cause we're gonna do our thing
'Cause you know it ain't over 'till the fat lady sings
Hangin' tough, hangin' tough, hangin' tough
Are you tough enough?
Hangin' tough, hangin' tough, hangin' tough
We're rough
[Repeat: x3]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Just hangin' tough
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hangin' tough
