04. Paula AbdulGreatest Hits: Straight Up!
Lost in a dream;
I don't know which way to go.
A-let me say if you are all that you seem,
Then baby, I'm movin' way too slow.
I've been fooled before;
Wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door.
How about some information, please?
Straight up, now tell me ,
Do you really wanna love me forever,
Oh, oh, or am I caught in hit and run?
Straight up, now tell me,
Is it gonna be you and me together,
Oh, oh, oh, or are you just havin' fun
Time's standing still waiting for some small clue.
I keep getting chills when I think your love is true.
I've been a fool before;
Wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door.
How about some information, please?
Straight up, now tell me ,
Do you really wanna love me forever,
Oh, oh, or am I caught in hit and run?
Straight up, now tell me,
Is it gonna be you and me together,
Oh, oh, oh, or are you just havin' fun
You are so hard to read.
You play hide and seek with your true intentions.
If you're only playin' games, I'll just have to say:
A b-b-b-bye, b-b-b-b-bye.
Do, do you love me, do you love me, baby?
Do, do you love me, do you love me, a hey baby?
Do, do you love me, do you love me, baby?
Do, do you love me, do you love me, a-tell me baby!
I've been fooled before;
Wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door.
How about some information, please?
