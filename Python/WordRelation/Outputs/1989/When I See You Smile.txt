34. Bad Englishalbum
Sometimes I wonder
How I'd ever make it through
Through this world without having you
I just wouldn't have a clue
'Cause sometimes it seems
Like this world's closing in on me
And there's no way of breaking free
And then I see you reach for me
Sometimes I wanna give up
I wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
And then I see you, baby
And everything's alright
Everything's alright
When I see you smile
I can face the world, oh oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light, oh oh
I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile
Baby, when I see you smile at me, oh yeah
Baby, there's nothing in this world
That could ever do
What a touch of your hand can do
It's like nothing that I ever knew
And when the rain is falling, I don't feel it
'Cause you're here with me now
And one look at you, baby
Is all I'll ever need, is all I'll ever need
When I see you smile
I can face the world, oh oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light, oh oh
I see it shining right through the rain
When I see you smile, baby
Baby, when I see you smile at me
Sometimes I wanna give up
I wanna give in
I wanna quit the fight
Then one look at you, baby
And everything's alright
Everything's alright, so right
When I see you smile
I can face the world, oh oh
You know I can do anything, yeah
When I see you smile
I see a ray of light, oh oh
I see it shining right through the rain, yeah
When I see you smile
Yeah, I can face the world, oh oh
You know I can do anything
When I see you smile, oh yeah
Baby, when I see you smile
Smile at me
