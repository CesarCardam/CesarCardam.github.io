Talk about the love you're missin'
Maybe then it's true when they say love is blind
I can help you if you listen
I can make you feel good if you just let my try
If everlasting love is what you're waiting for
Then that time for you just has arrived
So here I am come walk right through my door
And be loved for the rest of your life
Chorus:
If you talk about good lovin'
Let's talk about the lover in me (shoo do wop)
So don't go talk about no other
Just talk about the lover in me (shoo do wop)
I can give you all the lovin'
But I gotta know that you're there to receive
I can be your only woman
But I gotta feel that I'm all that you need
I'll be your everything and I can give you so much more
And I'll never leave you lonely at night
So here I am come walk right through my door
And be loved for the rest of your life
(Chorus X 2)
(Instrumental break)
Talk about and dream about and think about your lover
Don't talk about or dream about or think about no other
Don't run around all over town searchin' for some other
The love we found won't let us down let's talk about the lover...
I'll be your everything and I can give you so much more
And I'll never leave you lonely at night
So here I am come walk right through my door
And be loved for the rest of your life
(Chorus)
If you talk about and dream about and think about your lover
Don't talk about, think about or dream about no other
Don't run around all over town just searchin' for some other
This love we found won't let us down let's talk about the lover in me
(Chorus with ad-libs)
If you talk about and dream about and think about your lover
Don't talk about, think about or dream about no other
Don't run around all over town just searchin' for some other
This love we found won't let us down let's talk about the lover in me
(Chorus, fade)
