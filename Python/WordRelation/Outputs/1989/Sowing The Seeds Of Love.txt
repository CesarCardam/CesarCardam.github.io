58. Tears For FearsFamous Last Words: the Collection
High time, we made a stand
And shook up the views of the common man
And the love train rides from coast to coast
D.j.'s the man we love the most
Could you be, could you be squeaky clean and smash every hope of democracy
As the head line says you're free to choose
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues yeah, yeah
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
I spy tears in their eyes they look to the skies
For some kind of divine intervention
Food goes to waste
So nice to eat, so nice to taste
Politician granny with your high ideals
Have you no idea how the majority feels?
So with out love and a promised land
We're fools to the rules of a government plan
Kick out the style, bring back the jam, yeah, yeah
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
The birds and the bees
My girlfriend and me in love
Feel the pain
Talk about it
If you're a worried man
Then shout about it
Open hearts fell about it
Open minds think about it
Everyone read about it
Every one scream about it
Everyone (everyone, yeah)
Everyone (everyone) read about it, read about it
Read it in the books, in the crannies and the nooks, there are books to read
(Sowing the seeds) Sowing the seeds of love, we're sowing the seeds, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love
Mister England sowing the seeds of love
Time to eat all your words
Swallow your pride
Open your eyes
Time to eat all your words
Swallow your pride
Open your eyes
Time to eat all your words (High time we made a stand and shook up the view of the common man)
Swallow your pride (And the love train rides from coast to coast)
Open your eyes (every minute of every hour)
Open your eyes (I Love a sunflower)
Open your eyes (and I believe in love power, love power)
Open your eyes (love power)
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love
sowing the seeds, an end to need
And the Politics of Greed With Love
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love (hand in hand), seeds of love (hand in hand), sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
