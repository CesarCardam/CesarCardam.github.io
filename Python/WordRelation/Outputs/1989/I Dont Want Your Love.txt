62. Duran DuranThe Singles 1986-1995 [BOX SET]
I, don't mind, if you're keeping someone else behind,
I, don't care, cuz you've got something I can share,
Hey, take your chance, even if it's only -
Only while we're dancing in the light, of your second sight
Because when you understand me you might feel good around me now.
I don't want your love to bring me down.
I don't want your love so turn it around.
I, won't turn you out, if you've got someone else -
Someone else you care about, because you, must realize,
My obsessive fascination is in your imagination (now pick it up)...
I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around
(I don't what your love, I don't what your love)
Your rythym is the power - to move me
It's something you control - Completely,
I don't want your love,
I don't want your love.
(I Don't what your love)
I, like noise, cuz I like waking up the house
I cannot sit down, I can't shut my mouth,
But when you understand me,
You might feel good around me (now back it up)...
I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around
(I don't what your love, I don't what your love)
Your rythym is the power - to move me
It's something you control - Completely,
I don't want your love,
I don't want your love.
(I Don't what your love)
I don't want your love to bring me down
I don't want your love so turn it around
(I don't what your love, I don't what your love)
Your rythym is the power - to move me
It's something you control - Completely,
I don't want your love,
I don't want your love.
(I Don't what your love)
I don't want your love.
(I Don't what your love)
I don't want your love.
(I Don't what your love)
I don't want your love to bring me down..
(I Don't what your love)
