All This time
I knew some day you'd need to find
Something that you left behind
Something I can't give you
All these tears
And like a night love disappears
My heart's so good for souvenirs
And memories are forever
All This time
All and all I've no regrets
The sun still shines the sun still sets
And the heart forgives, the heart forgets
Oh what will I do now with all this time?
One more kiss
Even though it's come to this
I'll close my eyes and make a wish
Hoping you'll remember
All This time
All and all I've no regrets
The sun still shines the sun still sets
And the heart forgives, the heart forgets
Oh what will I do now with all this time?
Say Goodbye
A bond will make another time
Don't be sorry if you cry
I'll be crying too
All this time...
All This time
All and all I've no regrets
The sun still shines the sun still sets
And the heart forgives, the heart forgets
Oh what will I do now with all this time?
