91. BLACKstreet & Mya Featuring Mase & Blinky Blinkalbum
Take me there, I want to go there
Take me there. Let's go there
Take me to that great place with wonders and wishes
Take me there, I want to go there
Take me there. You know where
Just take me to that great place with wonders and wishes
Sittin here thinkin bout yesterday
About what we did and how we used to play
Just the thought of you brings a smile upon my face
That's how it makes me feel to see you everyday
Where we go, nobody knows
And what we do, is between me and you
So c'mon and take my hand, to that special place
Where smiles come to life and dreams come true
Let's make a wish
Close your eyes and count to five
'Cause you know that everything will be alright
I see the magic in your eyes
You're strong enough I know
To bring your dreams to life
Where we go, nobody knows
And what we do, is between me and you
So c'mon and take my hand, to that special place
I don't want this dream to ever go away
Now angelica's the one with all the exposure
Dil is the one who drop in the stroller
Tommy got the whole world on his shoulders
And dil cries to sleep
Til' his eyes get bleak
I'm identical to chuckie, chuckie to petro
Chuckie get scared, chuckie says "let's go"
If I was a rugrat, it would've been so real
Me and my twin would've been just like phil and lil
And with one wish, blink grant you one trip
Where we goin, it's an adventure, who you want to come with
See you're my little brother that I'll come get
Run with, but it's gotta be done quick
Yo chucky is scared and tommy is sad
And Phil and Lil misses their mom and dad
So take the time of day
And we'll find the place
And I guarantee that we will all get home safe
Just take me there
