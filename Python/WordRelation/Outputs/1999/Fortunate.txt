Oh
Never seen a sunshine like this
Never seen the moon glow like this
Never seen the waterfalls like this
Never seen the lights off like this
Never dug anyone like this
Never had tasty lips to kiss
Never had someone to miss
Never heard a song quite like this
Fortunate, to have you girl
I'm so glad, you're in my world
Just as sure, as the sky is blue
I bless the day, that I found you
Never had room service all night
Never took a trip first class flight
Never had a love affair so tight
I never felt a feeling so right
Never seen a winter so white
Never had words to recite
Never had a flame to ignite
And I never sang a song with all my might
Fortunate, to have you girl
I'm so glad, you're in my world
Just as sure, as the sky is blue
I bless the day, that I found you
Fortunate, to have you girl
I'm so glad, you're in my world
Just as sure, as the sky is blue
I bless the day, that I found you
Can you hear the silence shout?
(Silence shouts, I hope you hear, I'm calling out to your body)
I'm calling out
(Baby you know just what to do, close the door, no interviews)
Put your hands together now
Fortunate, to have you girl
I'm so glad, you're in my world
Just as sure, as the sky is blue
I bless the day, that I found you
Fortunate, to have you girl
I'm so glad, you're in my world
Just as sure, as the sky is blue
I bless the day, that I found you
