16. R. Kelly & Celine DionR
[Celine Dion]
No mountain's too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith
No river's too wide for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray
[R Kelly]
And then you will see the morning will come
and everyday will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see
[Chorus: Celine Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your Angel,
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your Angel, I'm your Angel
[R Kelly]
I saw your tear drops and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way
Let me show you a better day
[Celine Dion]
And then you will see, the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears just cast them on me
How can I make you see
[Chorus]
[R Kelly]
And when it's time to face the storm
[Celine Dion]
I'll be right by your side
[R Kelly]
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive
[Celine Dion]
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near (end is drawing near)
Don't you dare give up the fight
Just put your trust beyond the skies
[Chorus: Repeats]
