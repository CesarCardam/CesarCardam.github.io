10. Ricky MartinRicky Martin (1999)
She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall
She's into new sensation
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night
She'll make you take your
Clothes off and go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain
Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
She's livin la vida loca
Woke up in New York City
In a funky cheap hotel
She took my heart
And she took my money
She must've slipped me a sleepin' pill
She never drinks the water
And makes you order
French champagne
Once you've has a taste of her
You'll never be the same
Yeah, she'll make you go insane
Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
She's livin la vida loca
She'll make you take your
Clothes off and go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
Until you go insane
No, you'll never be the same
Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
Livin' la vida loca
Livin' la vida loca
Livin' la vida loca
Upside inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
Livin' la vida loca
Livin' la vida loca
Livin' la vida loca
