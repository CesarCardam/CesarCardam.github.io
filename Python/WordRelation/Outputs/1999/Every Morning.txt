Every morning there's a halo hangin
From the corner of my girlfriend's four post bed
I know it's not mine but I'll see if I can use it for
The weekend or a one-night stand
Couldn't understand
How to work it out
Once again as predicted left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out
Something's got me reeling
Stopped me from believing
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
Why'know I want to do it again
(Sugar Ray say)
Oh
(Every Morning)
Oh
(Every Morning when I wake up)
(Shut the door baby, don't say a word)
Oh
(She always rights wrongs, she always rights)
(Shut the door baby, Shut the door baby)
Every Morning there's a heartache hanging
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine and I know she thinks she loves me
But I never can believe what she said
Something so deceiving
When you stop believing
Turn me around again
Said we couldn't do it
Ya know I want to do it again
Oh
(Every Morning)
Oh
(Every Morning when I wake up)
(Shut the door baby, don't say a word)
Oh
(Every Morning)
Oh
(Every Morning when I wake up)
(Shut the door baby, shut the door baby)
She always rights the wrongs
For me
Baby
She always rights the wrongs
For me
Every Morning there's a halo hanging
From the corner of my girlfriends four-post bed
I know it's not mine but I'll see if I can use it for
The weekend or a one-night stand
(Shut the door baby, don't say a word)
Every Morning
Every Morning when I wake up
(Shut the door baby, shut the door Ray)
Every Morning
Every Morning (Turn me around again)
(Shut the door baby, don't say a word)
Every Morning
Every Morning
