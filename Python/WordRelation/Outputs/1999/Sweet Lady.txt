Sweet lady would you be my
Sweet love for a lifetime
I'll be there when you need me
Just call and receive me, sweet lady
Now any other day
I would play it cool
But I can't now cause I want you
See I'm hooked on
How you flex your style
And I wanna talk for a little while
I never really seen your type
But I must admit that I kinda like
So maybe if you have the time
We could talk about you being my
Sweet lady would you be my
Sweet love for a lifetime
I'll be there when you need me
Just call and receive me
Sweet lady would you be my
Sweet love for a lifetime
I'll be there when you need me
Just call and receive me
Now on the regular
I would waste time but I don't want to
Cause you're so damn fine
And I heard that you were taken
But that don't have to stop you from makin
Late night phone calls on the telephone
About your fantasies and ways to get it on
When you need me I will be
There for you my sweet lady
Sweet lady would you be my
Sweet love for a lifetime
I'll be there when you need me
Just call and receive me
Sweet lady would you be my
Sweet love for a lifetime
I'll be there when you need me
Just call and receive me
Say you will be my baby
Say you will be my lady
I've got to have all your love
So I wont even front
Just say you'll give it to me
Don't wanna hear the maybe's
And I will give you all my heart
If you say you'll be my baby
Sweet lady would you be my
Sweet love for a lifetime
I'll be there when you need me
Just call and receive me
Sweet lady would you be my
Sweet love for a lifetime
I'll be there when you need me
Just call and receive me
Sweet lady would you be my
Sweet love for a lifetime
