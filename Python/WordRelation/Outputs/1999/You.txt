59. Jesse Powellalbum
I've finally found the nerve to say
I'm gonna make a change in my life
Starting here today
I surrender all my love
I never thought I could
I'm giving all my love away
And there's only one reason that I would
And baby it's you
The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say my name, your smile
(You)
The way you move me
The way you soothe me
The way you sleep softly through the night
(You)
Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I just wanna be yours
From this day forth
Next year let's call this day our anniversary
The day I put my heart in your hand
And said that it was yours to keep
From this moment on
Say that you'll always be mine
Cause girl whe I'm alone with you
There's only one thing that's on my mine
And baby it's you
The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say my name, your smile
(You)
The way you move me
The way you soothe me
The way you sleep softly through the night
(You)
Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I just wanna be yours
From this day forth
