66. Dru HillEnter The Dru
It's taking everything in me
Not to kiss you over, under
Feel you inside, feel my thunder
How the hell could i not want cha
Girl it don't have to be a thang
I'll wait for you, you wait for me
Cause' true love is insisting we don't have to rush at all
These are the times we all wish for
The moment when less means so much more
We don't have to do a thing at all
We can just take our time and talk
And this is the way things need to be
No pressure from you and none from me
Just let the mood set the moment off
We can make love or not all
Be thinkin bout you all the time
Morning, noon and suppertime
Tear you up in little pieces
Swallow you like reeses pieces
Come on girl you know i need it
It ain't s'posed to be a thang
I know
If i wait for you, you'll wait for me
And i know
True loves insisting we don't have to rush at all
These are the times we all wish for
The moment when less means so much more
We don't have to do a thing at all
We can just take our time and talk
And this is the way things need to be
No pressure from you and none from me
Just let the mood set the moment off
We can make love or not all
I don't make promises
Cause i know my heart gets weak
I get around you
It makes them hard to keep
You bring out the best, you make me the man
God knows i'm proud to be
These are the times we all wish for
The moment when less means so much more
We don't have to do a thing at all
We can just take our time and talk
And this is the way things need to be
No pressure from you and none from me
Just let the mood set the moment off
We can make love or not all
