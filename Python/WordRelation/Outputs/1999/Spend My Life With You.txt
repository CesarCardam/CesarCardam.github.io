65. Eric Benet Featuring TamiaA Day In The Life
Oh oh
Um oh
La la la
Oh yeah
I never knew such a day could come
And I never knew such a love could be inside of one
And I never knew what my life was for
But now that you're here I know for sure
I never knew til I looked in your eyes (oh baby)
I was incomplete til the day you walked into my life (um, hm)
And I never knew that my heart could feel so precious and pure
One love so real, real
Can I just see you every morning when (every morning, babe)
I open my eyes
Can I just feel your heart beating beside me every night (every day)
Can we just feel this way together til the end of all time
(Can I just spend my life) Can I just spend my life with you (um, hm)
Now baby the days and the weeks and the years will roll by
But nothing will change the love inside of you and I
And baby I'll never find any words that could explain
Just how much my heart, my life, my soul you've changed
Can you run to these open arms when no one else understands
Can we tell God and the whole world I'm your woman and you're my man
Can you just feel how much I love you with one touch of my hand
Can I just spend my life with you
No touch has ever felt so wonderful (you are incredible)
Not a deeper love I've ever known (never let you go)
I swear this love is true (now and forever to you, to you, oh, oh)
Can I just see you every morning when I open my eyes
Can I just feel your heart beating beside me every night
Can we just feel this way together til the end of all time
Can I just spend my life with you
Can you run to these open arms when no one else understands
Can we tell God and the whole world
(You're my woman) and (you're my man)
Can you just feel how much I love you with one touch of my hand
Can I just spend my life with you
Can I just spend my life with you
Can I just spend my life with you (forever here with you)
Can I just spend my life with you
Can I just see you every morning when I open my eyes
Oh oh
