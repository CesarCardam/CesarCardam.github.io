Nine o'clock (Nine o'clock), home alone (home alone),
Paging you (Paging you),
Wishing you'd come over my place (My place)
After while (After while), let me know (Let me know)
We can't just keep talking about the last time (Last time)
You were here (You were here)
What we did (What we did)
(No sleep till morning)
Only bubble baths (Bubble baths)
And back rubs (Back rubs)
Hit me back (Hit me back)
Girl I hope you hurry 'cause
I'm so anxious so meet me at eleven-thirty
I love the way your talkin' dirty said I'm
So anxious girl could you quit this stallin'
You know I'm a sexaholic said I'm
So anxious so meet me at eleven-thirty
I love the way your talkin' dirty said I'm
So anxious, girl could you quit this stallin'
You know I'm a sexaholic said I'm
It' 10:10 (10:10)
Where you been (Where you been)
Did you get my message? (Get my message)
(Your expression is tellin' me that you've been thinkin' the same thang)
The same thang I've been thinkin' (I've been thinkin')
You say you're workin' (Say you're workin')
Well hit me just as soon as you're shift is over (Over)
And I'll be waitin' (I'll be waitin')
'cause I can't sleep (I can't sleep)
For reminiscin'
Reminscin' about you (About you)
And what we do (And what we do)
Hit me back (Hit me back)
And I you hope 'cause I'm
So anxious so meet me at eleven-thirty
I love the way your talkin' dirty said I'm
So anxious girl could you quit this stallin'
You know I'm a sexaholic said I'm
So anxious so meet me at eleven-thirty
I love the way your talkin' dirty said I'm
So anxious girl could you quit this stallin'
You know I'm a sexaholic said I'm
Said as soon as you hit the door
I'mma pull you down on the floor
And before we get to touch the bed
Baby back up every word you said
And before we, got to hit the lights
And before we start the candlelight
Baby girl I want to bump and grind
This is something that is on my mind
So anxious so meet me at eleven-thirty
I love the way your talkin' dirty said I'm
So anxious girl could you quit this stallin'
You know I'm a sexaholic said I'm
So anxious so meet me at eleven-thirty
I love the way your talkin' dirty said I'm
So anxious
