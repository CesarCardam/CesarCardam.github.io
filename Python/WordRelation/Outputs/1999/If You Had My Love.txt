12. Jennifer LopezDance Again: The Hits (Deluxe Version)
If you had my love and I gave you all my trust would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue would you lie to me
And call me baby
Now if I give you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all I won't take your cheating on me
Tell me who can I trust if I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool
You said that we could possibly spend eternity
See, that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me you'll have to be fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me baby
If you had my love and I gave you all my trust would you comfort me
Tell me baby
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue would you lie to me
And call me baby
You say you want my love and you got to have it all
But first there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live with all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah
I don't want you tryin' to get with me and I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain
So before I do give myself to you I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you
If you had my love and I gave you all my trust would you comfort me
What would you do babe, tell me right now
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue would you lie to me
And call me baby
Don't you lie to me
If you had my love and I gave you all my trust would you comfort me
Tell me baby
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue would you lie to me
And call me baby (don't you lie to me, baby)
If you had my love and I gave you all my trust would you comfort me
Tell me baby
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue would you lie to me
And call me baby
If you had my love and I gave you all my trust would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue would you lie to me
And call me baby
If you had my love and I gave you all my trust would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue would you lie to me
