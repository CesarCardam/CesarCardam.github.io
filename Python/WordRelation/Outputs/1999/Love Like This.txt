I never knew there was a
Love like this before
Never had someone to show me a love
Love like this before
Now that we have, come to be
A brand new light, I can see
Never thought you'd be
A special, part of me, no baby
The reasons are because of you
I can go on and make it through
I can't even take my mind off lovin' you
And I wanna say
I never knew there was a
Love like this before (A love like this before, no)
Never had someone to show me a love
Love like this before
I know, you can't see
All the things you mean to me
I'm so amazed that you are mine
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
If we can work together
Maybe this can last forever
This is somethin' that I wanna hold on to
So baby, try to understand
Baby, try to understand
I'll be crazy if you leave
'Cause you compliment my style
And I like the way you walk
And the sexy things you talk
You don't know just what you do to me
You see I never
I never knew there was a
Love like this before (A love like this before, no)
Never had someone to show me a love (Ooh I never had a)
Love like this before
I never knew there was a
Love like this before (Never knew, never knew)
Never had someone to show me a love
Love like this before
Baby, try to understand
I'll be crazy if you leave
'Cause you compliment my style
And I like the way you walk
And the sexy things you talk
You don't know just what you do to me
You see I never
Never knew a
Never knew a
Never knew a
Love like this before
Never knew a
Never knew a
Never knew a
Love like this before
I never knew there was a
Love like this before (Never had somebody)
Never had someone to show me a love
Love like this before
I never knew there was a
Love like this before (I never knew but I'll find you)
Never had someone to show me a love
Love like this before
I never knew there was a
Love like this before
Never had someone to show me a love
