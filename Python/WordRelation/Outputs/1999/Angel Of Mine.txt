03. MonicaThe Boy Is Mine
When I first saw you I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought that I would never find
Angel of mine
I look at you looking at me
Now I know why they say the best things are free
I gonna love you boy you are so fine
Angel of mine
How you changed my world you'll never know
I'm different now, you helped me grow
You came into my life
Sent from above
When I lost all hope
You showed me love
I'm checkin' for you
Boy you're right on time
Angel of mine
Nothing means more to me then what we share
No one in this whole world can ever compare
Last night the way you moved is still on my mind
Angel of mine
What you mean to me you'll never know
Deep inside I need to show
You came into my life
Sent from above (sent from above)
When I lost all hope
Boy you showed me love
I'm checkin' for you
Boy you're right on time
Angel of mine (angel of mine)
I never knew I could feel each moment
As if they were new
Every breath that I take
The love that we make
I only share it with you
You, you, you, you
When I first saw you I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought that I would never find
Angel of mine
You came into my life
Sent from above
When I lost all hope
You showed me love
I'm checkin' for you
Boy you're right on time
Angel of mine
How you changed my world you'll never know
I'm different you helped me grow
I look at you looking at me
Now I know why they say the best things are free
Checkin' for you boy your right on time
Angel of mine
