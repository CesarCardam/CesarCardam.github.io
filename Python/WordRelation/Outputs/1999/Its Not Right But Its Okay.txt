44. Whitney HoustonMy Love Is Your Love
Friday night you and your boys went out to eat
Then they hung out, but you came home around three
If six of y'all went out
Then four of you were really cheap
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt
It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
I pack your bags so you can leave town for a week (yes I am)
The phone rings and then you look at me (Why'd you turn and look at me)
You said it was one of your friends, down on 54th Street (boy)
So why did 213 show up on your caller ID
I've been through all this before
So how could you think
That I would stand around and take some more
Things are gonna change
'Cause I won't be your fool anymore
That's why you have to leave
So don't turn around to see my face
There's no more tears left here for you to see
Was it really worth you going out like that
See I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back
See all of this time I thought I had somebody down for Whitney
It turns out, you were making a fool of me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
And don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
