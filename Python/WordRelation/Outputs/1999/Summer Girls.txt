38. LFOLFO
Yeah, I like it when the girls
Stop by in the summer
Do you remember?
Do you remember
When we met, last summer?
New Kids On The Block
Had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly
When girls stop by
For the summer
For the summer
I like girls that
Wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer
Since that summer
Hip-hop mama, spic 'n span
Met you one summer
And it all began
You're the best girl
That I ever did see
The great Larry Byrd, jersey thirty-three
When you take a sip
You buzz like a hornet
Billy Shakespeare wrote
A whole bunch of sonnets
Call me when you miss me
'Cause I can't speak baby
Something in your eyes
Really drove me crazy
Now I can't forget you
And it makes me mad
You left one day
And never came back
Stayed all summer
Then went back home
Macualay Culkin wasn't home alone
Fell deep in love but
Now we ain't speaking
Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton
When I met you
I saw my name is Rich
You look like a girl
From Abercrombie and Fitch
New Kids On The Block
Had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly
When girls stop by
For the summer
For the summer
I like girls that
Wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer
Since that summer
Cherry pants Coke
Crushed rocks till I boogie
Used to hate school
So I had to play hookie
Always been hip to the b ball style
Known to act wild and
Make a girl smile
Love New Edition and the Candy Girl
Remind me of you
Because you rock my world
You come from Georgia
Where the peaches grow
They drink lemonade
And speak real slow
You love hip-hop
And rock 'n' roll
Dad took off when
You were four years old
There was a good man
Named Paul Revere
I feel much better baby
When you're near
You love Fun Dip and Cherry Coke
I like the way you laugh
When I tell a joke
When I met you
I said my name is Rich
You look like a girl
From Abercrombie and Fitch
New Kids On The Block
Had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly
When girls stop by
For the summer
For the summer
I like girls that
Wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer
Since that summer
In the summertime
Girls got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle to
A hip-hop song
Summertime girls
Are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like
I stole your bike
Bugalute shrimp and pogo sticks
My mind takes me back
There oh-so quick
Let you off the hook
Like my man Mr. Limpit
Think about that summer
And I bug 'cause I miss it
Like the color purple
Macaroni and cheese
Ruby-red slippers
And a bunch of trees
Call you up but what's the use?
I like Kevin Bacon
But I hate Footloose
Came in the door
I said it before
Think I'm over you
But I'm really not sure
When I met you
I said my name is Rich
You look like a girl
From Abercrombie & Fitch
New Kids On The Block
Had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly
When girls stop by
For the summer
For the summer
I like girls that
Wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer
Since that summer
In the summer girls come
And summer girls go
Some are worthwhile
And some are so-so
Summer girls come
And summer girls go
Some are worthwhile
And some are so-so
Summertime girls
Got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle
To a hip-hop song
Summertime girls
Are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey
Like I stole your bike
New Kids On The Block
Had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly
When girls stop by
For the summer
For the summer
I like girls that
Wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone
Since that summer
Since that summer
