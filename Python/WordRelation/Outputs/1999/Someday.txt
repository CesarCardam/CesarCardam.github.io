Someday when my life has passed me by
I'll lay around and wonder why you were always there for me
One way, in the eyes of a passer by
I'll look around for another try and fade away
Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm and without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me
Some say better things will come our way
No matter what they try to say you were always there for me
Some way, when the sun begins to shine
I hear a song from another time and fade away
And fade away
Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm and without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me
Oh, come on
Someone said you tried to long (you will pass me by)
Someone said we got it all wrong (all wrong)
Someone said we tried to long (you will pass me by)
Every thinks were right belong
So far so long so far away
So far so wrong so far away away away
Someday when my life has passed me by
I'll lay around and wonder why you were always there for me
One way, in the eyes of a passer by
I'll look around for another try and fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
