20. TLCNow &amp; Forever
I wish could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you
Look into the mirror who's inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today (yeah)
My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through
It's because of you
I've tried different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I too
Be in the position to make me feel so
Damn unpretty
(Yeah) I'll make you feel unpretty too
Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm bein' stupid
I used to be so cute to me
Just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things
To keep you happy
Maybe get rid of you and then I'll get back to me (hey)
My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through
It's because of you
I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
Believe I'm just trippin' yeah
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I too
Be in the position to make me feel so
Damn unpretty
I'll make you feel unpretty too
I'll make you feel unpretty
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can't look inside you
Find out who am I too
Be in the position to make me feel so
Damn unpretty
You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
