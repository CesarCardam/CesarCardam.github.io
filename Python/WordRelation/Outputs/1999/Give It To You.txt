63. Jordan Knightalbum
You say its been too long
Since you had some
You say I turn you on
Like a fire that's burning inside
You think that I'm the one
You see in your dreams
I know what you mean yeah
It's creepin around in your head
Me holding you down in my bed
You don't have to say a word
I'm convinced you want this
[Chorus]
Baby you know I can give it to you
I can't deny you do it right
Just let me know and I'll give it to you
Just show me where, I'll take you there
Baby you know that I'll give it to you
Your body needs a man like me
Anything goes when I give it to you
You know without a doubt, I'll turn you out
I'll give it to you
The feeling is fine, giving you everything of mine
I'm the place to be
And soon, you'll see
I don't care who leads
As long as we move horizontally
Anyone can make you sweat
But I, can keep you wet
It's creepin' around in my head
Me holding you down in my bed
I can't wait to give you some
I'm convinced you need it
[Chorus]
It's creepin' around in my head
Me holding you down in my bed
You don't have to say a word
Just relax, I'll do the work
I can't wait to give you some
I'm convinced you need one
[Chorus]
I want to satisfy your every wish and mine baby
I know just what you need,(you need)to get you off
No one could ever do you like I do you right baby
There's nothing we can't do
The feeling is fine giving you everything of mine
