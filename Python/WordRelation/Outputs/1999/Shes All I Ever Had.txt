52. Ricky MartinRicky Martin (1999)
Here I am
On broken wings
Quiet thoughts
Unspoken dreams
Here I am
Alone again
I need her now
To hold my hand
She's all, she's all I ever had
She's the air I breath, yeah
She's all, she's all I ever had
It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
When I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I want to be
She's all I'll ever need
So much time
So much pain (but)
There's one thing
That still remains (it's the)
The way she cared
The love we shared
And through it all
She's always been there
She's all, she's all I ever had
In a world so cold, so empty
She's all, she's all I ever had
It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
And when I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I want to be
She's all I'll ever need
She's all, she's all I ever had
I love to make her see
She's all, she's all I ever had
It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
And when I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I want to be
She's all I'll ever need
It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
And when I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I want to be
She's all I'll ever need
Here I am
