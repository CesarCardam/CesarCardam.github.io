04. Whitney HoustonMy Love Is Your Love
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
You said you'd be here by nine
Instead you took your time
You didn't think to call me boy
Here I sit trying not to cry
Asking myself why
You'd do this to me
Since you're not around for me to tell you baby, face to face
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say:
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me
Can't take what you did to me
Now I see that you've been doing wrong
You played me all along
And made a fool of me, baby
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out
That you were cheating on me
How could you do it to me
Since you're not around for me to tell you baby, face to face
I'm writing you this letter, and this is what I have to say:
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me
Can't take what you did to me
Heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
This is the heartbreak hotel
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me
Can't take what you did to me
All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead you told me lies
When someone else was on your mind
What you do to me
Look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me
Can't take what you did to me
I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna take it no more
I ain't gonna take it no more
I ain't gonna take it no more
Everything that you said was a lie
Don't lie to me
Tell me what it is and I will be alright
