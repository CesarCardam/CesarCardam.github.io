I do I do now
I do I do
All I am, all I'll be
Everything in this world
All that I'll ever need
Is in your eyes shining at me
When you smile I can feel
All my passion unfolding
Your hand brushes mine
And a thousand sensations
Seduce me 'cause I
I do cherish you for the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will love you still from the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much, I do, oh baby oh
In my world before you
Lived outside my emotions
Didn't know where I was going
Until that day, I found you
How you opened my life
To a new paradise
In a world torn by change
Still with all my heart
Until my dying day
I do cherish you for the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will love you still from the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much, yes I do
I do
If you're asking do I love you this much
Baby, I do cherish you from the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much, baby I do
I do.
