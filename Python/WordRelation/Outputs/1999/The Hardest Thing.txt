We both know that I shouldn't be here
This is wrong and baby it's killing me, It's killing you
Both of us trying to be strong
I've got somewhere else to be, promises to keep
Someone else who loves me and trusts me fast asleep
I've made up my mind, there is no turning back
She's been good to me and she deserves better than that
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye and tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion when you start to cry
I can't let you see what you mean to me
When my hands are tied and my heart's not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To turn around and walk away pretending I don't love you
I know we'll meet again, fate has a place and time
So you can get on with your life, I've got to be cruel to be kind
Like Dr. Zhivago, All my love I'll be sending and you will never know
'Cause there can be no happy ending
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye and tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion when you start to cry
I can't let you see what you mean to me
When my hands are tied and my heart's not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To turn around and walk away pretending I don't love you
Maybe another time, another day, as much as I want to, I can't stay
I've made up my mind there is no turning back
She's been good to me and she deserves better than that
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye and tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion when you start to cry
I can't let you see what you mean to me
When my hands are tied and my heart's not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To turn around and walk away pretending I don't love you
