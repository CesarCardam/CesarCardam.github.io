See he's my property
And any girl that touch
I might just call your bluff
'Cause I don't give a fuck
Who are you to call my cell
Oh I'ma wish you well
'Cause any girl that tried has fell
Where my girls at
From the front to back
Well is you feelin' that
Put one hand up
Can you repeat that
Tryin' to take my man
See I don't need that
So don't play yourself
Where my girls at
From the front to back
Well is you feelin' that
Put one hand up
Can you repeat that
Tryin' to take my man
See I don't need that
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't you violate me
'Cause I'ma make ya hate me
If you decide to mess with mine
Shrunk you down to size
Make ya realize
You done messed up this time
You must learn the rules
Don't come close to
Anything that belongs to me
He is my
My property
So you must leave
(Repeat till end)
