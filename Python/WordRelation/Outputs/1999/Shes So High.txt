51. Tal Bachmanalbum
She's blood, flesh and bones
No tucks or silicone
She's touch smell sight taste and sound
But somehow I can't believe that anything should happen
I know we're right where I belong and nothing's gonna happen, yeah
Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
She's so high
High above me
First class, fancy free, she's high society
She's got the best of everything
Why could a guy like me ever really offer?
She's perfect as she can be, why should I even bother, ah ha
Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
She's so high
High above me
She comes to speak to me
I freeze immediately
Cause what she says sounds so unreal
Cause somehow I can't believe that anything should happen
I know we're right below and nothing's gonna happen
Cause she's so high
High above me, she's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite
She's so high
High above me
She's so high
High above me
