17. B.J. Thomasalbum
It's lonely out tonight
And the feelin' just got right for a brand new love song
Somebody done somebody wrong song
Hey, wontcha play another somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home while I miss my baby, while I miss my baby
So please play for me a sad melody
So sad that it makes everybody cry-why-why-why
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong
Cause I don't want to cry all alone
Hey, won't ya play another somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home while I miss my baby, while I miss my baby
So please play for me a sad melody
So sad that it makes everybody cry-why-why-why
A real hurtin' song about a love that's gone wrong
Cause I don't want to cry all alone
Hey, won't ya play another somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home while I miss my baby, while I miss my baby
Hey, won't ya play another somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home while I miss my baby, while I miss my baby
Hey, won't ya play another somebody done somebody wrong song
And make me feel at home while I miss my baby, while I miss my baby
