47. Linda RonstadtHeart Like a Wheel
I've been cheated, been mistreated
When will I be loved
I've been put down, I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved
When I find a new man that I want for mine
Always breaks my heart in two, it happens every time
I've been made blue, I've been lied to
When will I be loved
When I find a new man that I want for mine
Always breaks my heart in two, it happens every time
I've been cheated, been mistreated
When will I be loved
When will I be loved
Tell me when will I be loved
