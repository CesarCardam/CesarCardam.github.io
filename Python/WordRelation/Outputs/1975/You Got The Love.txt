Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smilin', smilin'
Comes as no surprise
Smilin' ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
The story goes much deeper
Than the eye can see yes it do
Stop runnin' a game
I can tell you're avoiding me
Oh ain't nothin'
I wouldn't pay
Just to hear, hear you say
I love you, I need you
Love me right
What's the matter with you
Hold me tight
Why must I tell you what to do
Smilin', smilin'
Comes as no surprise
Smilin' ain't hidin'
What I see in your eyes
You got the love
Gimme the strength
To keep on livin'
Whatever it is
I can't do without what cha givin'
Oh, ain't nothin'
I wouldn't pay
Just to hear, just hear you say
I love you, I need you
You got the love
To gimme the strength
To keep on livin' yeah
Whatever it is
I can't do without
What cha givin'
