Spirit move me every time I'm near you
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind
Sweet Melissa, angel of my lifetime
Answer to all answers I can find
Baby, I love you, come, come
Come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
And, baby, I want you, now, now
Now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last?
Lady take me
Hight upon a hillside
High up where the stallion meets the sun
I could love you
Build my world around you
Never leave you 'till my life is done
