How long has this been goin' on
How long has this been goin' on
Well, if friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicions
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem
And you said you was never intendin'
To break up our singing this way
But there ain't any use in pretendin'
It could happen to us any day
How long has this been goin' on
How long has this been goin' on
[Musical Interlude]
Oh, your friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicion
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem
Oh, you said you was never intending
To break up our singing this way
But there ain't any use in pretendin'
It could happen to us any day
And how long has this been going on
How long has this been going on
How long
How long has this been going on
How long has this been going on
How long has this been going on
How long
How long has this been going on
