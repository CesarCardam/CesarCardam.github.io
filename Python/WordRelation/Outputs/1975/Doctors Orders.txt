63. Carol Douglasalbum
Hello
Hiya honey
It's me I want to see the doctor today
"Cos ever since you've been gone
I've had a pain deep down inside
He said, there's nothing really wrong with me
I'm just missing my man, so honey
Please, come on home as soon as you can
Doctor's orders say, there's only one thing for me
Nothing he can do 'cos only you can cure me
Says in my condition love's the best physician
He's prescribed a potion full of warm emotion
Every day a lovin' spoonful to be taken
It's the only way to stop this empty heart of mine from breakin
Song text taken from stlyrics.com
Won't get better till you're back again
He told me, doctor's orders need your loving arms to hold me
Darling, now I know there ain't no doubt about it
I'm so hooked on your love, I can't live without it
You're away but please don't treat me like a stranger
Doctor's orders say, one kiss from you and I am out of danger
[Musical Interlude]
"Please say you understand how I feel honey
I know you've got a lot of things on your mind
Oh, but I'm missing you so bad
Please, oh please, come on home"
