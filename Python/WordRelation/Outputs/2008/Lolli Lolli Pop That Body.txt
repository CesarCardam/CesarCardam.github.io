Please lord, have some mercy
This girl is throwin' judi
I think she bout to hurt me
See she went front then back
She went side to side
I'm throwin' blank checks
I think I need a ride
One pocket full of pills
A little bag of that cola
The other one full of weed
And a semi auto pistol-a
I ain't no dancin' dude
But I can lean like a cholo
See mami go with me 'cause
I can't be goin home solo

They call me the juice when I'm at strip club
I put down a hundred or a dub
I'm a mac to a playa
I'm a stud
Cause when I leave the club I'm a fuck
Ride with the man and be givin up the brain
Little skinny I'm a ride with ya
I don't even know your name
There's a whole lot of room in the front of the van
Like Barack Obama said it's time for a change
Put a roll on the back seat
Pop that body now you know that ya got me
You'll find a chick that's kinda classy
Said her name was Antine now I'm grabbin'
Got a grip on the whip
Big round booty with the silicone tits
She bouncin' on my lap and she tryin' own the six
I whispered in her ear it's hard for a pimp

Punchin' bag lookin' for a model
Poppin' that booty
