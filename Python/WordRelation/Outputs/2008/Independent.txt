I N D E P E N D E N T do you know what that mean mane (x2)

I N D E P E N D E N T do you know what that mean
Baby Phat just relax front ya own flat screen
Back rubs cook clean and don't make her make her seen
When you call her on her cellular
She tell she don't need
Not a god damn thing you a hot damn thing
If you think you finna get her wit a god damn chain
You insane boy you betta get some god damn change
She a fool been in school even walked across the stage
She say I love Webbie from his looks to his ways
The stilletos the jays depend on how the weather look
Flip flops slippers just to show off the pedicure
Flip flop niggas depend on how the cheddar look
She'll buy her own I don't think she 'll never look
In a man face standin' waitin for him to take care of her
She'll rather go to work and pay the bills on schedule
I N D E P E N D E N T do you know what that mean mane (x2)
She got her own house
