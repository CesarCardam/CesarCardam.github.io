I've been waiting for my dreams
To turn into something I could believe in
And looking for that, magic rainbow
On the horizon, I couldn't see it until I let go
Gave into love and watched all the bitterness burn
Now I'm coming alive, body and soul
And feelin' my world start to turn
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time
To be more than a name
Or a face in the crowd, I know this is the time
This is the time of my life, time of my life
Holding onto things that vanished
Into the air, left me in pieces
But now I'm rising from the ashes
Finding my wings and all that I needed
Was there all along within my reach
As close as the beat of my heart
And I'll taste every moment
And live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time
This is the time of my life time of my life
And I'm out on the edge of forever, ready to run
I'm keeping my feet on the ground arms open wide face to the sun
I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time this is the time of my life, time of my life
More than a name or a face in the crowd
This is the time, this is the time of my life, this is the time of my life.
Time of my life, time of my life
