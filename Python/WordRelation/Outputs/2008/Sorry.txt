Oh I have a lot to say
I was thinking on my time away
I miss you and things weren't the same
Cause everything inside, it never comes out right
And when I see you cry it makes me want to die
I'm sorry you're bad
I'm sorry you're blue
I'm sorry about all the things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss
I love all your sounds
Baby the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry
This time, I think I'm to blame
It's harder to get through the days
You get older and blame turns to shame
Cause everything inside, it never comes out right
And when I see you cry it makes me want to die
I'm sorry I'm bad
I'm sorry I'm blue
I'm sorry about all the things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss
I love all your sounds
Baby the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry
Every single day
I think about how we came all this way
The sleepless nights and the tears you cried
It's never too late to make it right
Oh yeah, sorry!
I'm sorry I'm bad
I'm sorry I'm blue
I'm sorry about all the things I said to you
And I know I can't take it back
I love how you kiss
I love all your sounds
Baby the way you make my world go round
And I just wanted to say, I'm sorry
I'm sorry baby
I'm sorry baby
Yeah, I'm sorry.
