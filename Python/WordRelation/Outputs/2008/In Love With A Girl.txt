87. Gavin DeGrawSweeter Live
So many people gonna say that they want you,
To try to get you thinking they really care,
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
Who has put in the time and you know he's gonna be there,
Back your border when she knows someone crossed it,
Don't let nobody put you down, who your with
Take the pain of protecting your name,
From the crutch to the cane to the high wire
I'm in love with a girl who knows me better,
Fell for the women just when I met her,
Took my sweet time when I was bitter,
Someone understands,
And she knows how to treat a fella right,
Give me that feeling every night,
Wants to make love when I wanna fight,
Now someone understand me,
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with) [x2]
Out the many broken back doors and windows,
Through the valley of the love of the lost,
Is a hole that is cut through the souls falling down
From the thrones without leaving any windows,
But you drown in a piece for the moment,
The moment was over in time,
Then its gone the hit and run the tactless one has a short life
I'm in love with a girl who knows me better,
Fell for the women just when I met her,
Took my sweet time when I was bitter,
Someone understands,
And she knows how to treat a fella right,
Give me that feeling every night,
Wants to make love when I wanna fight,
Now someone understand me,
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with) [x2]
Gonna tell you what you do to think you practice what you preach,
Now I know there's nothing we cant preach,
Cause the heart can't erase once it
Finds a place to be warm and welcome,
To be held in shelter
I'm in love with a girl who knows me better,
Fell for the women just when I met her,
Took my sweet time when I was bitter,
Someone understands,
And she knows how to treat a fella right,
Give me that feeling every night,
Wants to make love when I wanna fight,
Now someone understand me,
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with) [x2]
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
Who knows me better
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
