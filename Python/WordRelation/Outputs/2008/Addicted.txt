97. Saving AbelSaving Abel
I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Oh the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me
Oh girl lets take it slow
So as for you well you know where to go
I want to take my love
And hate you till the end
It's not like you to turn away
From all the bullshit I can't take
It's not like me to walk away
I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Oh the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me
Yeah
I know when it's getting rough
All the times we spend
Trying to make
This love something better than
Just making up again
It's not like you to turn away
All the bullshit I can't take
Just when I think I can walk away,
I'm so addicted to all the things
You do when you're going on me
In between the sheets
All the sounds you make
With every breathe
It's unlike anything
I'm so addicted to the things you do
When you're going down on me
All the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything when you're loving me
When you're loving me
How can I make it through
All the things you do
There's just got to be more to you and me
I'm so addicted to all the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
All the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
It's unlike anything
I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
All the sounds you make
With every breath You take
It's unlike anything
I'm so addicted to you
Addicted to you
