51. Colby O'Donis Featuring AkonColby O
I peeped you on the phone
Just showin' off ya stones
And notice that that pinky ring is bright enough baby
I know you're not alone
But I could just be wrong
The way them fellas houndin' and sizin' you up baby
And I like the way you take advantage of
Every man you love
I see, and I know your game girl
But I don't mind if ya come and play with us
Just don't talk too much
I see, you're so cute you don't have to say a word
See those guys wanna come treat ya right
'Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin hot
Girl you know that you need to stop
Always talkin' bout what you got
Always talkin' bout what you got
Always talkin' bout what you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Always talkin' bout what you got
Always talkin' bout what you got
Always talkin' bout what you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Girl I can tell you want something to love
That's why you hold on to everything that pass you by
Can't resist girl and I can't lie
Now tell if you are here for me
Or everybody watchin' you shake from left to right
The way you move got me hypnotized
The way you take advantage of
Every man you love
I see, and I know your game girl
But I don't mind if ya come and play with us
Just don't talk too much
I see, you're so cute you don't have to say a word
See those guys wanna come treat ya right
'Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin hot
Girl you know that you need to stop
Always talkin' bout what you got
Always talkin' bout what you got
Always talkin' bout what you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Always talkin' bout what you got
Always talkin' bout what you got
Always talkin' bout what you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
My eyes away from you girl when you get on the floor and do what you do
And everybody wanna come back to that body the kind and remind myself I'm like you
'Cause your that type to drive a man crazy will snatch him away from his lady
No matter how hard the man hold back he'll end up callin' you baby
And they never really know what to do once you expose that thing you do
Ya had him crawlin' on hands and knees and ya find a way to get 'em out that cheese
And why ya thinkin' you the only dude she off in the mall livin' off of you
Lettin' everybody know she got you but now you feel like a fool
See those guys wanna come treat ya right
'Cause you're sweeter than apple pie
Everything that you want you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Most beautiful thing in sight
Always takin' on the spotlight
Always in the club lookin hot
Girl you know that you need to stop
Always talkin' bout what you got
Always talkin' bout what you got
Always talkin' bout what you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
Always talkin' bout what you got
Always talkin' bout what you got
Always talkin' bout what you got
Girl you know that you need to stop
