62. Rihanna Featuring Ne-YoGood Girl Gone Bad
That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did
(But I hate it) You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
(But I hate it) You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you
