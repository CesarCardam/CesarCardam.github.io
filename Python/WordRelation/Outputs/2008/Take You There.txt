We can go to the tropics
Sip pina coladas
Shorty I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums
Where killers get hung
Shorty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya)
I could take ya (I could take ya)
Shorty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya)
I could take ya (I could take ya)
Shorty I could take you there
Baby girl I know it's rough but come with me
We can take a trip to the hood
It's no problem girl it's my city
I could take you there
Little kid with guns only fifteen
Roam in the streets up to no good
When gun shots just watch us, run quickly
I could show you where
As long you're with me
Baby you'll be alright
I'm known in the ghetto
Girl just stay by my side
Or we can leave the slums go to paradise
Baby it's up to you
It's whatever you like
We can go to the tropics
Sip pina coladas
Shorty I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums
Where killers get hung
Shorty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya)
I could take ya (I could take ya)
Shorty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya)
I could take ya (I could take ya)
Shorty I could take you there
Shorty come with me it's no worry
I know the bad men them where they ah stay
Police fly pursuit in a hurry
This is no gun play
Don't be scared in the West Indies
It's Jamaica, that's where I'm from
Might see something you're not used to
Welcome to the slums
As long you're with me
Baby you'll be alright
I'm known in the ghetto
Girl just stay by my side
Or we can leave the slums go to paradise
Baby it's up to you
It's whatever you like
We can go to the tropics
Sip pina coladas
Shorty I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums
Where killers get hung
Shorty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya)
I could take ya (I could take ya)
Shorty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya)
I could take ya (I could take ya)
Shorty I could take you there
Or we (or we)
Can go (can go)
To a place (to a place)
I know you gonna like (oh oh oh)
The beach (the beach)
The breeze (the breeze)
West Indies, I call it paradise
We can go to the tropics
Sip pina coladas
Shorty I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums
Where killers get hung
Shorty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya)
I could take ya (I could take ya)
Shorty I could take you there
You know I could take ya (I could take ya)
I could take ya (I could take ya)
Shorty I could take you there
