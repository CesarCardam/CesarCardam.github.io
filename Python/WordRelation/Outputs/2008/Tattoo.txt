Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh, oh
No matter what you say about love,
I keep coming back for more,
Keep my head in the fire,
Sooner or later I get what I'm asking for
No matter what you say about life,
I learn every time I bleed the truth is a
Stranger soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free, to
Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry but I have to move on and leave you behind
I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry bout everything I done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back got a new direction
I loved you once
Needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo I'll always have you
I'll always have you
I'll always have you
I'm sick of playing all of these games
Its not bout taking sides
When I looked in the mirror,
It didn't deliver, it hurt enough to think that I could stop
Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry but I got to be strong and leave you behind
I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken
No need to worry bout everything I done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back got a new direction
I love you once
Needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo
I'll always have you
I'll always have you
I'll always have you
If I live every moment,
Won't change any moment,
There's still a part of me in u
I will never regret you
Still the memory of you
Marks everything I do, oh
I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken no need to worry bout everything I done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back got a new direction
I loved you once
Needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're in my heart just like a tattoo
I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize nothing's broken no need to worry bout everything I done
Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back got a new direction
I loved you once
Needed protection
You're still a part of everything I do
You're in my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo
I'll Always have you
