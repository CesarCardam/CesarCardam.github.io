31. Miley Cyrusalbum
I got my sights
Set on you
And I'm ready to aim
I have a heart
That will never be tamed
I knew you were
Something special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait
To see you again
I've got a way
Of knowing
When something is right
I feel like
I must have known
You in another life
Cause I felt
This deep connection
When you looked
In my eyes
Now I can't wait
To see you again
The last time
I freaked out
I just kept
Looking down
I st-st-stuttered
When you asked me
What I'm thinking about
Felt like
I couldn't breath
You asked
What's wrong with me
My best friend
Lesley said
"Oh
She's just being Miley"
The next time
We hang out
I will redeem myself
My heart can't rest
Till then
Whoa whoa I
I can't wait
To see you again
I got
This crazy feeling
Deep inside
When you called
And asked
To see me
Tomorrow night
I'm not
A mind reader
But I'm reading
The signs
That you can't wait
To see me again
[Chorus]
I got my sights
Set on you
And I'm ready
To aim
[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa I
I can't wait
To see you again
