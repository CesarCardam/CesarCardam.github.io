And you know what I mean ahh... baam baam
Radio Killa... ahh
Should beat the track up like Gorrilla...
AHH AHH!
Yeah We be up club, I see her do her thang,
I might wanna' rap, but she'll make you sing,
I was on her, she was on him,
She all up on ma thang, put tha thang on her hip
She ATL papa, don't know how to act,
She left for one song, and came right back,
Grindin on me, (The best tonight?)
Her man started muggin', he could see it in my eyes,
[Chorus:]
Lil' mama so hood, (I love your girl)
Lil' mama stay fly (I love your girl)
Wife beater with the denim (I love your girl)
She keeps them heels on high, (I love your girl)
Man look at shorty roll, (I love your girl)
Man, look at shorty go, (I love your girl)
(I'm sorry I gotta be up on your wild girlfriend?)
[Bridge:]
And she runnin' Fingers through her hair, tryin ta call her over there but she like, Fuck! That nigga!
She drop it down to the floor, I'm sayin shorty you should go, and she like Fuck! That nigga!
Call it in B, I want her on me, all up in my head, now she in my bed,
I, IIIIII, III
Me and lil shorty in the back, Talkin' bout dis diss, talkin' bout dat dat,
Got her on patron?, she actin' all bad,
Girl chose me, Don't be mad.
Kelly told y'all don't bring 'em in the club,
The way she rock that, got the boy in love,
And I pray that y'all ain't serious, cause seriously shes on my dick.
[Chorus:]
Lil' mama so hood, (I love your girl)
Lil' mama stay fly (I love your girl)
Wife beater with the denim (I love your girl)
She keeps them heels on high, (I love your girl)
Man look at shorty roll, (I love your girl)
Man, look at shorty go, (I love your girl)
(I'm sorry I gotta be up on your wild girlfriend?)
[Bridge:]
And she runnin' Fingers through her hair, tryin ta call her over there but she like, Fuck! That nigga!
She drop it down to the floor, I'm sayin shorty you should go, and she like Fuck! That nigga!
Call it in B, I want her on me, all up in my head, now she in my bed,
I, IIIIII, III
OH, III, ehh, ehh, OH, III

Usually, You won't see me hate,
On another dude,
Ma got me up and get willin to separate you
From ya boo,
But she on me, and I'm on her,
We walkin' out the club, shawty what's up,
Mm I want her in the worst way, plus I just found out that it's her birthday
[Chorus:]
Lil' mama so hood, (I love your girl)
Lil' mama stay fly (I love your girl)
Wife beater with the denim (I love your girl)
She keeps them heels on high, (I love your girl)
Man look at shorty roll, (I love your girl)
Man, look at shorty go, (I love your girl)
(I'm sorry I gotta be up on your wild girlfriend?)
[Bridge:]
And she runnin' Fingers through her hair, tryin ta call her over there but she like, Fuck! That nigga!
She drop it down to the floor, I'm sayin shorty you should go, and she like Fuck! That nigga!
Call it in B, I want her on me, all up in my head, now she in my bed,
