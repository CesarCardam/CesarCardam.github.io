98. Santana Featuring Chad KroegerUltimate Santana
Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, like it saved me from hell
She had fire in her soul, it was easy to see how the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands and we sang
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing, ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh, ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night
Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place
You could tell how we felt from the look on her face
She was spinning in circles with the moon in her eyes
The room left them moving between you and I
We forgot where we were, and we lost track of time
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night, and we sang
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing, ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And we danced on into the night
Ay oh ay oh, ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night
And we danced on into the night
Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell
It was love from above, like it saved me from hell
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me
There were drums in the air as she started to dance
Every soul in the room keeping time with there hands, and we sang
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay, and the voices rang like the angels sing
We're singing ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
And we danced on into the night, ay oh ay oh, ay oh ay oh
And we danced on into the night (And the voices rang like the angels sing)
Ay oh ay oh, ay oh ay oh, and we danced on into the night, ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
(Ay oh ay oh) Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
(Ay oh ay oh) Singing ay oh ay oh ay oh ay
(Ay oh ay oh) And we danced on into the night
