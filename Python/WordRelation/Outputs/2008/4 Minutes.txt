Break down, come on
Hey, uh

Come on boy
I've been waiting for somebody
To pick up my stroll, uh
Well don't waste time
Give me a sign
Tell me how you wanna roll, uh, hm
I want somebody to speed it up for me
Then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go
(Are you ready to go)
If you want it
You already got it
If you thought it
It better be what you want
If you feel it
It must be real just
Say the word and
I'm a give you what you want
Time is waiting
We only got four minutes to save the world
No hesitating

Sometimes I think what I need
Is a you intervention, yeah
And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good,
By the way that you move, ooh, hey
The road to hell is paved
With good intentions, yeah
But if I die tonight
At least I can say I did
What I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?
If you want it
You already got it
If you thought it
It better be what you want
If you feel it
It must be real just
Say the word and
I'm a give you what you want

No hesitating
Grab a boy, grab a girl
Time is waiting
We only got four minutes to save the world
No hesitating
