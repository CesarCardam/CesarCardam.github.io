Hey baby girl, I've been watching you all day (all day, all day, all day)
Man that thing you got behind you is amazing (amazing, amazing, amazing)
You make me want to take you out
And let it rain (let it rain, let it rain, let it rain)
I know you got a man but this is what you should say
Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin' never looking back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry, no more them gray skies
Girl we flying on the G5
And I'm leavin' never looking back again?
So call you shawty and tell him you found a new man
The one who's so so fly
The one that keep you high
Have me singing all night night night
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, man she got me singing
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Now if I talk it girl,
You know that I will walk it out (walk it out, walk it out, walk it out)
Man I'll put my money (money) where my mouth is (mouth is, mouth is, mouth is)
Cause you the baddest little thing
That I've ever seen (ever seen, ever seen, ever seen)
So I'ma ask you one time if you got a man
Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin' never looking back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry, no more them gray skies
Girl we flying on the G5
And I'm leavin' never looking back again?
So call you shawty and tell him you found a new man
The one who's so so fly
The one that keep you high
Have me singing all night night night
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, man she got me singing
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
Just tell him to the left left left
Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
Cause we gone and we gone and we gone
No stress, no stress, no stress
Girl you deserve nothing but the best
No stress, no stress, no stress
Girl you need to tell him
Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin' never looking back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry, no more them gray skies
Girl we flying on the G5
And I'm leavin' never looking back again?
So call you shawty and tell him you found a new man
The one who's so so fly
The one that keep you high
Have me singing all night night night
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, man she got me singing
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
