72. Natasha Bedingfield Featuring Sean KingstonPocketful of Sunshine
Talk to me baby
Oh?
Never find a love like this
Oh?
Hey, let's go!
Never find a love like this
We go back so far
Swinging in your back yard,
All the things that we used to do
We were cool back in high school
Oh I really liked you,
Must have been your attitude
That's why you keep on running
In and out of my mind.
As the years they'll roll by
Baby, now I know why
I keep coming back to you
You're the only one that knows me
Love it when you hold me
Never find a love like this
Let me hear you say
Now I'll never be lonely
Look at what you've shown me
Never find a love like this
Well this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me
Wrap your world around me
Never find a love like this
All the guys tried to take me
You're the one who saved me
I feel like I owe you my life
And as strange as it may seem
I'll go if you take me
I'm willing to sacrifice
That's why you keep on running
In and out of my mind.
As the years they'll roll by
Baby, now I know why
I keep coming back to you
You're the only one that knows me
Love it when you hold me,
Never find a love like this
Let me hear you say
Now I'll never be lonely
Look at what you've shown me
Never find a love like this
'Cause this life tried to keep us apart,
You keep calling me back to your hear
Let me hear you say,
I'm so glad you found me
Wrap you all around me
Never find a love like this
May never find a love, love, love a love like this
That still make me think about my middle school kiss
I sit here in this chair and I wish
For you not to leave me now
My friends they always told me
Not to make you my wifey,
Man they was putting you down
And now they see we rolling
Me and you, we strolling
They don't wanna come around
Let me hear you say,
You're the only one that knows me
Love it when you hold me
Never find a love like this
Let me hear you say,
Now I'll never be lonely
Look at what you've shown me
Never find a love like this
When this life tries to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say,
I'm so glad you found me
Wrap you all around me
Never find a love like this
Oh, never find a love like this
Oh, never find a love like this
Oh, never find a love like this
Oh, never find a love like this
Now I'll never be lonely
Look at what you've show me
Never find a love like this
Oh, never find a love like this?
When this life tried to keep us apart
You keep calling me back to your heart
Let me hear you say
Oh, never find a love like this
Oh, never find a love like this
