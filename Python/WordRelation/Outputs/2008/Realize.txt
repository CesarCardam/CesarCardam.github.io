67. Colbie CaillatCoco
Take time to realize
That your warmth is
Crashing down on me
Take time to realize
That I am on your side
Didn't I, didn't I tell you?
But I can't spell it out for you
No, it's never gonna be that simple
No, I can't spell it out for you
If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other and we'd never find another
Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder if we missed out on each other, now
Take time to realize
Oh, oh, I'm on your side
Didn't I, didn't I tell you?
Take time to realize
This all could pass you by
Didn't I tell you?
But I can't spell it out for you
No, it's never gonna be that simple
No, I can't spell it out for you
If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other and we'll never find another
Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder if we missed out on each other, but
It's not the same
No, it's never the same
If you don't feel it, too
If you meet me half way
If you would meet me half way
It could be the same for you
If you just realize what I just realized
Then we'd be perfect for each other and we'll never find another
Just realize what I just realized
We'd never have to wonder
Just realize what I just realized
If you just realize what I just realized
Missed out on each other now
Missed out on each other now
Realize, realize, realize, realize
