Don't be scared

They told me stuntin' was an art form(like Da Vinci)
Winter time no top but the car on(Lamborghini)
We don't park we leave the car on
The bad bitches gimme hard on

My garage like horses in the stable(horsees)
Cars all pretty
Hard or more drippy like the Frankie better
It's banks stopped all betters
It's tank top in good weather
My niggas all wit it
Treat out whips like our bitches
We take the top off
And then we jump off in they guts
Just like we jump up in the sluts
They say we smoke good
Puff Ferraris up in dope hoods
Because we so hood it's all good
Say stuntin' is a habit, so put it in the air
