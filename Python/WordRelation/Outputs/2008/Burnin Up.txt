73. Jonas BrothersA Little Bit Longer
I'm hot
You're cold
You go around
Like you know
Who I am
But you don't
You've got me on
My toes (toes, toes)
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby you turn the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you baby
Come on girl
I fell (I fell)
So fast (so fast)
Cant hold myself back (back, back)
High heels (high heels)
Red dress (red dress)
All by yourself
Gotta catch my breath
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from goin' under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you baby
Walk in the room
All I can see is you
Oh
Staring me down
I know you feel it too
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm tryin' to keep from goin under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cuz' I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you baby
Slipping into the lava
And I'm trying to keep from going under
Baby who turned the temperature hotter
Cause I'm burnin' up, burnin' up
For you baby
Burnin' up in the place tonight
And the brothers singing loud (and were feelin' right)
Get up and dance (don't try to fight it)
Big robs for real (and that's no lie)
Stop,drop and roll (and touch the floor, to keep from burnin' up)
More and more
I got JB with me (laying it down)
Come on boys bring the chorus around
I'm slipping into the lava (burnin' up, burnin' up)
And I'm trying to keep from going under (yeahhhh)
Baby who turned the temperature hotter (come on nick)
Cause I'm burnin' up
Burnin' up for you baby
Burnin' up,burnin' up
For you baby
