53. Leona LewisSpirit
It's been the longest winter without you
I didn't know where to turn to
See somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through
Going coming
Thought I heard a knock (Whose there, no one?)
Thinking that (I deserve it)
Now I have realized
That I really didn't know
If you didn't notice
You mean everything (quickly I'm learning)
To love again (all I know is)
Imma be okay
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's going to hurt when it heals too
Oh yeah (It'll all get better in time)
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile because I deserve too
Oh (It'll all get better in time)
How could I turn on the TV
Without something that'll would remind me
Was it all that easy?
To put aside your feeling
If I'm dreamin'
Don't want to let it (hurt my feelings)
But that's the past (i believe it)
And I know that, time will heal it
If you didn't notice
Well you mean everything (quickly I'm learning)
Oh turn up again (All I know is)
I'm be OK
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's going to hurt when it heals too
Oh yeah (It'll all get better in time)
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile because I deserve too
Oh (It'll all get better in time)
Since there's no more you and me (No more you and me)
This time I let you go so I can be free
And live my life how it should be (No no no no no no)
No matter how hard it is
I will be fine without you
Yes I will
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's going to hurt when it heals too
Oh yeah (It'll all get better in time)
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile because I deserve too
Oh (It'll all get better in time)
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's going to hurt when it heals too
Oh yeah (It'll all get better in time)
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile because I deserve too
Oh (It'll all get better in time)
