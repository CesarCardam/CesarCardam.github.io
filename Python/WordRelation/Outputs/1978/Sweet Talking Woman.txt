86. Electric Light Orchestraalbum
I was searchin' (searchin') on a one-way street
I was hopin' (hopin') for a chance to meet
I was waitin' for the operator on the line
(She's gone so long)
What can I do?
(Where could she be?)
Don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta get back to you
You gotta slow down (slow down), sweet talkin' woman
You got me runnin', you got me searchin'
Hold on (hold on), sweet talkin' lover
It's so sad if that's the way it's over
I was (walkin'), many days go by
I was thinkin' (thinkin') 'bout the lonely nights
Communication break down all around
(She's gone so long)
What can I do?
(Where could she be now?)
No no no, don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta get back to you
You gotta slow down (slow down), sweet talkin' woman
You got me runnin', you got me searchin'
Hold on (hold on), sweet talkin' lover (hold on)
It's so sad if that's the way it's over
I've been livin' on a dead-end street
I've been askin' ev'rybody I meet
Insufficient data coming through
(She's gone so long)
What can I do?
(Where could she be?)
No no no, don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta get back to you
Slow down (slow down), sweet talkin' woman
You got me runnin', you got me searchin'
Hold on (hold on), sweet talkin' lover (hold on)
It's so sad if that's the way it's over
Slow down (slow down), sweet talkin' woman
You got me runnin', you got me searchin'
Hold on (hold on), sweet talkin' lover (hold on)
It's so sad if that's the way it's over
Slow down (slow down), sweet talkin' woman
You got me runnin', you got me searchin'
Hold on (hold on), sweet talkin' lover (hold on)
It's so sad if that's the way it's over
Slow down (slow down), sweet talkin' woman
You got me runnin', you got me searchin'
Hold on (hold on), sweet talkin' lover (hold on)
It's so sad if that's the way it's over
Slow down (slow down), sweet talkin' woman
You got me runnin', you got me searchin'
