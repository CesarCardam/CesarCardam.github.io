60. Dolly PartonThe Essential Dolly Parton, Vol. 2
Here you come again
Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger
Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you.
All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again and here I go
All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there got all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again, and here I go, here I go
And here I go
And here I go
Here you come again and here I go
Here I go
