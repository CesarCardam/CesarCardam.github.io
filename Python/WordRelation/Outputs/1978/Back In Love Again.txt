57. L.T.D.album
Every time I move I lose...when I look I'm in
And every time I turn around...I'm back in love
I get mixed emotions...it's the way my feelings flow
Excuse me I'm only human...sometimes I...I just don't know
Every time I move I lose...when I look I'm in
And every time I turn around...I'm back in love again
(do do do do do...back in love again...do do do do do)
Back in love
When you put your arms around me...I feel so satisfied
I want to love you forever...I just can't...I can't decide
Every time I move I lose...when I look I'm in
And every time I turn around...I'm back in love again
(right back, right back...in love again) Alright (seems like, seems like)
Back in love...again
Now it's your lover...I know it's hard just to be a friend
That's something else I discovered...I guess I just don't ever want it to end
Every time I move I lose...when I look I'm in
And every time I turn around...I'm back in love again
(right back, right back...in love again...seems like, seems like)
That I'm back in love...again
(right back, right back...in love again) Alright (seems like, seems like)
I'm back in love again
I just don't believe it...back in love again
(right back, I'm back) I can't believe it
(right back, I'm back) Every time I turn around...back in love again
(right back, I'm back) I get so many mixed emotions...I'm back in love again
(right back, I'm back) Every time I turn around...oh my love Jones coming down
Back in love again
(right back, I'm back) Alright...alright...alright
(I'm back, I'm back) Help me, help me, help me...back in love
(I'm back, I'm back) Oh yeah...back in love again
(right back, I'm back) I get so many mixed emotions...yes I do
