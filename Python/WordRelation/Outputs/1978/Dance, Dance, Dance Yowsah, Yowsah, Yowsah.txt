Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on dancin'
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Just dancin' to the beat, feel the heat
I'm movin' my feet
Headed towards the floor, gonna get down
A-get down some more
Rumba and Tango
Latin Hustle, too
Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah
I want to boogie wit'choo
Bop bop bop bop bow
Oh, what a treat, feels so sweet
(Ah) That body heat
When I'm dancin' with my baby drives me crazy
Makes me hazy
Rumba and Tango
Latin Hustle, too
Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah
I want to boogie wit'choo
Bop bop bop bop bow
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on, keep on
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on dancin'
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on, keep on
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
