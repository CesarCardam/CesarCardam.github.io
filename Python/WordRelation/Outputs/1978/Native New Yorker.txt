91. Odysseyalbum
Native New Yorker
Odyssey
New York girl, ooh, ooh, ooh
Runnin' pretty, New York City girl
Twenty-five, thirty-five
Hello, baby, New York City girl
You grew up ridin' the subways, running with people
Up in Harlem, down on Broadway
You're no tramp, but you're no lady, talkin' that street talk
You're the heart and soul of New York City
And love, love is just a passing word
It's the thought you had in a taxi cab that got left on the curb
When he dropped you off and he stated firm
Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
You're a native New Yorker
You should know the score by now (you should know by now)
You're a native New Yorker
New York girl, ooh, ooh, ooh
Music plays, everyone's dancin' closer and closer
Makin' friends and findin' lovers
There you are lost in the shadows, searchin' for someone
(Searchin' for someone)
To set you free from New York City
And, whoa, where did all those yesterdays go
When you still believed love could really be like a Broadway show
You are the star, win the applause
Oh, oh, oh (oh, oh, oh)
You're a native New Yorker
No one opens the door
For a native New Yorker
(Runnin' pretty, New York City girl)
Ooha, ooha, ooha
Native, native, native New Yorker
Where did all those yesterdays go
When you still believed love could really be like a Broadway show
You are the star
You're a native New Yorker
You should know the score by now
You're a native New Yorker
You should know the score, you should know the score by now
You're a native New Yorker, oh, oh, oh
(Native, native, native New Yorker)
You're a native New Yorker
Whoa, oh, ho, ho, you're a native New Yorker
You should know the score
(Native, native, native New Yorker)
You're a native New Yorker
What you waitin' for, no one opens the door
(You're a native New Yorker)
For a native, for a native New Yorker
