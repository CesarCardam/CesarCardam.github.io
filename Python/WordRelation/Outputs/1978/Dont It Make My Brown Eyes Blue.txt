Don't know when I've been so blue
Don't know what's come over you
You've found someone new and
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
I'll be fine when you're gone
I'll just cry all night long
Say it isn't true and
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies
Give me no reasons, give me alibies
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say goodbye
I didn't mean to treat you bad
Didn't know just what I had
But honey now I do
And don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes
Don't it make my brown eyes blue
