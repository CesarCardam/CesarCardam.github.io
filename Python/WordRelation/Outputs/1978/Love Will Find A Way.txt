44. Pablo Cruisealbum
Someone, someone's got me wrong
You thought that your love was strong
Now you're feelin' like such a fool
Poor you, you're thinkin' maybe if you said goodbye
You'll understand the reason why
The love you had felt so cool um hm
Oh but it's all right
Once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
Cause love will find a way
Sometimes we all feel a need to change
Our love we have to rearrange
And move on to something new yes you do
Your dreams feel like they're fallin' apart
You need to find a brand new start
But you're almost afraid to be true to yourself
Oh, but it's all right
Once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
Cause love will find a way
Love will find a way
Love will find a way
So now don't, don't be afraid of yourself
Just move on to something else
And let your love shine through
Again yes 'cause it's all right
Once you get past the pain
You'll learn to find your love again
So keep your heart open
Cause love will find a way
