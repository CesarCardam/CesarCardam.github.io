96. Bob WelchFrench Kiss
Well have you seen that girl in the corner
I'd like to take her out of her chains
'Cause if I have my way with you baby I would be changing your life today
Your eyes got me dreamin
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hopin
That I'll be holding you close tonight
Your eyes got me dreamin
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hopin
That I'll be holding you close tonight
She was the same as a hundred ladies
But when my eyes looked at her I learned
That she was keepin a secret fire
And if I got real close I'd burn
So it looked like I had to move slowly
Like a cat at night in the trees
'Cause I was waiting for her to show me
The way that she like her love to feel
Your eyes got me dreamin
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hopin
That I'll be holding you close tonight
Your eyes got me dreamin
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hopin
That I'll be holding you close tonight
Ebony eyes, ebony eyes
Ebony eyes, ebony eyes
Your eyes got me dreamin
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hopin
That I'll be holding you close tonight
Your eyes got me dreamin
Your eyes got me blind
Your eyes got me hopin
That I'll be holding you close tonight
