66. Jefferson Starshipalbum
Precious love
I'll give it to you
Blue as the sky and deep in the
Eyes of a love so true
Beautiful face
You make me feel
Lite on the stairs and lost in the
Air of a love so real
And you can count on me girl
You can count on my love
Woman
You can count on me baby
You can count on my love to see
You through
Emerald eyes and China perfume
Caught in the wheel and lost in
The feel of a love so soon
Ruby lips
You make my song
Into the night and saved by the lite
Of a love so strong
See you through
Oh
You can count on me girl
You can count on my love
