Written by Kenny Loggins and M. Manchester.
(KL)
Whenever I call you friend
I begin to think I understand
Anything we are
You and I have always been ever and ever
(KL/SN)
I see myself within your eyes
And that's all I need to show me why
Everything I do, always takes me home to you
Ever and ever
(KL)
Now I know my life has given me more
Than memories day by day...we can see
(SN)
In every moment there's a reason to carry on
(Chorus) (KL/SN)
Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
Sweet love flowin' almost every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it
Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
Sweet love flowin' almost every night
I know forever we'll be doin' it right
(SN)
Whenever I call you friend
I believe I've come to understand
Everywhere we are you and I were meant to be
Forever and ever
(KL)
I think about the times to come
Knowin' I will be the lucky one
Ever our love will last
I always want to call you friend
(Chorus) sax solo
(SN)
Now I know my life has given me more
Than memories...(KL)day by day...we can see
(SN)
In every moment there's a reason to carry on
(Chorus)
Sweet love...sweet love yeah
Sweet love...sweet love yeah
