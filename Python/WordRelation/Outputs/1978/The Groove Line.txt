49. Heatwavealbum
Pack your grip takin you on a trip
Ain't no seats all we got's dancin feet
Leave your worries behind
Cause rain shine don't mind
We're ridin on the groove line tonight
Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh
Get this train know you'll be glad you came
Hit the track party hard there and back
Leave your worries behind
Cause rain shine don't mind
We're ridin on the groove line tonight
Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh
Check out the wheels a turnin
You know we won't stop
We got this boiler burnin
We're keepin it hot
So grab your friends get the train comin thru
Climb on board where you leave's up to you
Leave your worries behind
Cause rain shine don't mind
We're ridin on the groove line tonight
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Leave your worries behind
Cause rain shine don't mind
We're ridin on the groove line tonight
Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh
Check out the wheels a turnin
You know we won't stop
We got this boiler burnin
We're keepin it hot
So grab your friends
Get the train comin' through
Climb on board
Where you lead is up to you
Leave your worries behind
Cause rain shine don't mind
We're ridin on the groove line tonight
Ooh Ooh
We can ride
Rain shine don't mind
We're ridin on the groove line tonight (repeat and fade)
