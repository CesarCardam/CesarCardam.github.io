When I get home, babe, gonna light your fire
All day I've been thinkin' about you, babe
You're my one desire
Gonna wrap my arms around you
Hold you close to me
Oh, babe I want to taste your lips
I want to fill your fantasy, yeah
I don't what I'd do without you, babe
Don't know where I'd be
You're not just another lover
No, you're everything to me
Ev'rytime I'm with you, baby
I can't believe it's true
When you're layin' in my arms
'n' you do the things you do
You can see it in my eyes
I can feel it in your touch
You don't have to say a thing
Just let me show how much
I love you, need you, oh babe
I want to kiss you all over
And over again
I want to kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
No one else can ever make me
Feel the way you do
Oh, so keep on loving me baby
And I'll keep loving you
Well it's easy to see
When something's right or something's wrong
So stay with me baby and hold me all night long
Show me, show me everything you do
'Cause baby no one does it quite like you
I love you, need you, oh babe
I wanna kiss you all over
And over again
I wanna kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Stay with me, lay with me
Holding me, loving me, baby
Here with me, near with me
Feeling you close to me, baby
Show me, show me everything you do
'Cause baby no one does it quite like you
Love you, need you, oh yea
I wanna kiss you all over
And over again
I wanna kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
Wanna kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in
When I get home, baby
Gonna light your fire
