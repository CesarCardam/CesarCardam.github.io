75. HeatwaveAlways and Forever: Love Songs and Smooth Grooves
Always and forever
Each moment with you is just like a dream to me
That somehow came true
And I know tomorrow will still be the same
'Cause' we've got a life of love that won't ever change
And every day love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together
I'll always love you, forever, forever
There'll always be sunshine when I look at you
Something I can't explain, just the things that you do
And if you get lonely, phone me
And take a second to give to me the magic you make
And every day love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together
I'll always love you, forever, forever
