13. John Travolta & Olivia Newton-Johnalbum
I got chills, they're multiplyin', and I'm losin' control
'Cause the power you're supplyin', it's electrifyin'
You better shape up, 'cause I need a man, and my heart is set on you
You better shape up, you better understand, to my heart I must be true
Nothing left, nothing left for me to do
You're the one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh
The one I need (the one I need), oh yes indeed (yes indeed)
If you're filled with affection, 'n you're too shy to convey
Meditate my direction, feel your way
I better shape up, 'cause you need a man
I need a man, who can keep me satisfied
I better shape up, if I'm gonna prove
You better prove, that my fate is justified
Are you sure?
Yes I'm sure down deep inside
You're the one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh
The one I need (the one I need), oh yes indeed (yes indeed)
You're the one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh
The one I need (the one I need), oh yes indeed (yes indeed)
You're the one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh
The one I need (the one I need), oh yes indeed (yes indeed)
You're the one that I want (you are the one I want), ooh ooh ooh
