Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter
Say, my mind, should I go with her on silent nights
She'll drive me crazy in the end
And I should leave this paradise
But I can't leave her
while I need her more than she needs you
That's what I'm living for
Love is, higher than a mountain
Love is, thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter
Say my thought, should I find out she don't care at all
She'll leave me crying in the end
Wandering through the afterglow
But I can't leave her
While I need her more than she needs you
That's what I'm praying for
Love is, higher than a mountain
Love is, thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter
Love is, higher than a mountain
Love is, thicker than water
You are this dreamers only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter
La ....
