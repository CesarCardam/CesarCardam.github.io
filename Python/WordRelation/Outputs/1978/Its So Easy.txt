It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
People tell me love's for fools
Here I go breaking all the rules
Seems so easy
Yeah, so doggone easy
Oh it seems so easy
Yeah where you're concerned
My heart can learn
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
Look into your heart and see
What your lovebook has set aside for me
It seems so easy
Yeah, so doggone easy
Oh it seems so easy
Yeah where you're concerned
My heart can learn
Oh it's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
