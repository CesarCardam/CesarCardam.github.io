59. Carly SimonNever Been Gone
Why'd you tell me this
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be your girl
You don't have to prove to me
You're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes
Of my own
[Chorus]
You belong to me
Tell her, tell her you were fooling
You belong to me
You don't even know her
You belong to me
Tell her that I love you
You belong to me
You belong to me
Can it be, honey
You're not sure
You belong to me
Thought we'd closed the book
Locked the door
You don't have to prove to me
That you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own, of my own
And I can tell
I can tell darling
[Chorus x2]
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
Baby, I really love you
You belong to me
Tell her, tell her
Tell her she don't know you
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
Cause you belong to me
