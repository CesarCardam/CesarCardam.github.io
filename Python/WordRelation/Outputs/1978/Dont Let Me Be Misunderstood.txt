Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
Well don't you know that no-one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that
All I have to do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
If I seem edgy, I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has it's problems and I get my share
And that's one thing I never mean to do
Cause I love you
Oh, oh, oh, baby, don't you know I'm human
Have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself alone and regretting
Some foolish thing, some little simple thing I've done
I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Yes, I'm just a soul who's intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
