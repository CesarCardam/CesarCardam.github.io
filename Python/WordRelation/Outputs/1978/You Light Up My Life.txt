03. Debby Boonealbum
So many nights I'd sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark but now you've come along
And you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days and fill my nights with song
Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turnin' for home?
Finally a chance to say "Hey, I love you"
Never again to be all alone
And you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days and fill my nights with song
'Cause you, you light up my life
You give me hope to carry on
You light up my days and fill my nights with song
It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you.....you light up my life
