63. Young Rascalsalbum
How can I be sure in a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure where I stand with you?
Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
I wanna die 'cause you know I wanna stay with you.
How do I know? Maybe you're trying to use me.
Flying too high can confuse me. Touch me but don't take me down.
Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
My alibi is telling people I don't care for you.
Maybe I'm just hanging around with my head up upside down.
It's a pity, I can't seem to find someone who's as pretty
and lovely as you.
How can I be sure? I really really really wanna know.
I really really really wanna know. Oh.
