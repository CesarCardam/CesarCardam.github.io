7-A
What number is this to?
7-A
Okay, don't get excited man, it's 'cause I'm short, I know
Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the bluebird as she sings
The six-o'clock alarm would never ring
But six rings and I rise
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
The shaving razor's cold and it stings
Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean to a
Daydream believer and a
Homecoming queen?
You once thought of me
As a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, our good time starts and ends
Without all I want to spend
But how much, baby, do we really need?
Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean to a
Daydream believer and a
Homecoming queen?
Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean to a
Daydream believer and a
Homecoming queen?
Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean to a
Daydream believer and a
Homecoming queen?
Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh, what can it mean to a
Daydream believer and a
Homecoming queen?
Cheer up, sleepy Jean
