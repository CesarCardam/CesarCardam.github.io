78. Turtles45 rpm Singles Collection
Some girls love to run around
Love to handle everything they see
But my girl has more fun around
And you know she'd rather be with me
Me oh my, lucky guy is what I am
Tell you why, you'd understand
She don't fly, although she can
Some boys love to run around
They don't think about the things they do
But this boy wants to settle down
And you know he'd rather be with you
Me oh my, lucky guy is what I am
Tell you why, you'd understand
She don't fly, although she can
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Some girls love to run around
Love to handle everything they see
But my girl has more fun around
And you know she'd rather be with
Yeah she'd rather be with
You know she'd rather be with me
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ah you know she'd rather be with me
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ah you know she'd rather be with me
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ah you know she'd rather be with me
