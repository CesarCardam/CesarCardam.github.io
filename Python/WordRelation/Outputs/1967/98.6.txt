Good mornin' sun I say it's good to see you shinin'
I know my baby brought you to me
She kissed me yesterday hello your silver linin'
Got spring and summer runnin' through me
Hey 98.6 it's good to have you back again, oh
Hey 98.6 her lovin' is the medicine that saved me
Oh I love my baby
Hey everybody on the street I see you smilin'
Must be because I found my baby
You know she's got me on another kind of highway
I want to go to where it takes me
Hey 98.6 it's good to have you back again, oh
Hey 98.6 her lovin' is the medicine that saved me
Oh I love my baby
You know she's got me on another kind of highway
I want to go to where it takes me
Hey 98.6 it's good to have you back again, oh
Hey 98.6 her lovin' is the medicine that saved me
Oh I love my baby
