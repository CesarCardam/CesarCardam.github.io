74. MonkeesPisces Aquarius Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd
The local rock group down the street
Is trying hard to learn their song
They serenade the weekend squire
Who just came out to mow his lawn
Another pleasant valley Sunday
Charcoal burning everywhere
Rows of houses that are all the same
And no one seems to care
See Mrs.Gray, she's proud today
Because her roses are in bloom
And Mr.Green, he's so serene
He's got a TV in every room
Another pleasant valley Sunday
Here in status symbol land
Mothers complain about how hard life is
And the kids just don't understand
Creature comfort goals, they only numb my soul
And make it hard for me to see
(Ah ah ah) ah thoughts all seem to stray to places far away
I need a change of scenery
Ta ta ta ta, ta ta ta ta
Ta ta ta ta, ta ta ta ta
