82. Four TopsLegenden des Soul
Bernadette, people are searchin' for the kind of love that we possess
Some go on searchin' their whole life through
And never find the love I've found in you
And when I speak of you I see envy in other men's eyes
And I'm well aware of what's on their minds
They pretend to be my friend
When all the time they long to persuade you from my side
They'd give the world and all they own for just one moment we have known
Bernadette, they want you because of the pride that gives
But Bernadette, I want you because I need you to live
But while I live only to hold you some other men
They long to control you
But how can they control you Bernadette
When they can not control themselves, Bernadette
From wanting you, needing you
But darling, you belong to me
I'll tell the world you belong to me
I'll tell the world, you're the soul of me
I'll tell the world you're a part of me
In your arms I find the kind of peace of mind the world is searching for
But you, you give me the joy this heart of mine has always been longing for
In you I have what other men long for
All men need someone to worship and adore
That's why I treasure you and place you high above
For the only joy in life is to be loved
So whatever you do
Bernadette, keep on loving me, Bernadette, keep on needing me Bernadette
You're the soul of me
On that dream, you're a ? to me
And Bernadette, you mean more to me
Than a woman was ever meant to be
