Along the sand
Let's walk the shore together, now, just hand in hand
It's gonna be fair weather, now,
When the stars come out, stop to count them in the sky
Love California nights
When I'm walkin' with you hand in hand by the shore,
Yes, I love California nights,
At the beach where we'd swim with the tide rolling in
And there will be beneath the midnight sky above
Just you and me, and we will whisper words of love
While the fire light softly flickers in the sand
Warm California nights
With the breeze blowin' in time for love to begin
I would miss California nights if I went on my way
Thinkin' now that I'll stay
Ooh, baby,
Love you, baby
Mm, baby
Love California nights,
Always close as a kiss, nothing's sweeter than this,
And we'll spend California nights,
Always close as a kiss
