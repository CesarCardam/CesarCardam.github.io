56. TemptationsLegenden des Soul
You surely must know magic, girl, 'cause you changed my life
It was dull and ordinary
But you made it sunny and bright
I, I was blessed the day I found you, gonna build my whole world around you
You're ev'rything good, girl and you're all that matters to me
When my way was dark and troubles were near
Your love provided the light so I couldn't see, girl
Just knowing your love was near when times were bad
Kept the world from closing in on me, girl
I was blessed the day I found you, gonna build my whole world around you
You're ev'rything good, girl and you're all that matters to me
You're part of ev'ry thought I think each day
Your name is in ev'ry phrase my lips say
Ev'ry dream I dream is about you
Honey I couldn't live without you
Baby, baby, baby, you're my ev'rything
You're my ev'rything
Yes, you are, you're my ev'rything
Girl, you're the girl I sing about in ev'ry love song I sing
(You're my everything)
You're my winter, baby, my summer, my fall and spring
(You're my everything)
I was blessed the day I found you, gonna build my whole world around you
You're ev'rything good, girl and you're all that matters to me
You're my ev'rything
You're my everything
You're my ev'rything
You're my everything
