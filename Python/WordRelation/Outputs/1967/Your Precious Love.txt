32. Marvin Gaye & Tammi TerrellCollected
Ooh, everyday, there's something new (oh, baby)
Honey, to keep me loving you (oh, honey)
And with every passing minute
Oh baby, so much joy wrapped up in it (sugar)
Oh, heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love
Oh, and now, I've got a song to sing
Tellin' the world about the joy you bring (sweetheart)
And you gave me reason for living
And ooh, you taught me
You taught me the meaning of giving
Oh-oh, heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, heaven must have sent your precious love, oh
To find a love like yours is rare these days
'Cause you've shown me what happiness is in so many ways
I look in the mirror and I'm glad to see
Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be
What you've given me I could never return (baby)
'Cause there's so much, girl, I've yet to learn
And I want to show my appreciation
'Cause when I found you
I found a new inspiration
