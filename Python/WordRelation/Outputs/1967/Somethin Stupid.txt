07. Nancy Sinatra & Frank SinatraSugar
I know I stand in line,
Until you think you have the time
To spend an evening with me
And if we go someplace to dance,
I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me
And afterwards we drop into
A quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all,
By saying something stupid
Like "I love you".
I can see it in your eyes,
That you despise the same old lies
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you,
For me it's true
It never seemed so right before
I practice every day to find
Some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait until
The evening gets late
And I'm alone with you
