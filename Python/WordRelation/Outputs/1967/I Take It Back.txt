88. Sandy Poseyalbum
Here he comes now. I've got to tell him somehow.
I could put it off till later but it's best I do it now.
Baby listen to me there is something I must try to say
I've put it off so long but I've decided that today is the day
My love for you is dying
Oh no, please don't start crying
I take it back
I didn't mean it
Please forget the things I said
I take it back
I'm sorry
I must have been out
Of my head
He's such a man. It must have hurt him a lot if he let me
See him cry. But I must try again, this time I'll say goodby.
Baby you've been good to me you've always been the best you could
So try to understand me now the way you've always understood
I can't go on another day
Oh please, don't look at me that way
I take it back
I didn't mean it
Please forget what I just said
I take it back
I'm sorry
I must have been out
Of my head
