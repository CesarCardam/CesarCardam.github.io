49. CowsillsThe Cowsills
I saw her sitting in the rain
Raindrops falling on her
She didn't seem to care
She sat there and smiled at me
Then I knew
She could make me happy
Flowers in her hair
Flowers everywhere
I love the flower girl
Oh, I don't know just why, she simply caught my eye
I love the flower girl
She seemed so sweet and kind, she crept into my mind
To my mind
I knew I had to say hello
She smiled up at me
And she took my hand
And we walked through the park alone
And I knew
She had made me happy
Flowers in her hair
Flowers everywhere
I love the flower girl
Oh, I don't know just why, she simply caught my eye
I love the flower girl
She seemed so sweet and kind, she crept into my mind
To my mind
Suddenly, the sun broke through
I turned around, she was gone
All I had left
Was one little flower in my hand
But I knew
She had made me happy
Flowers in her hair
Flowers everywhere
I love the flower girl
Was she reality or just a dream to me?
I love the flower girl
Her love showed me the way to find a sunny day
Sunny day
I love the flower girl
Was she reality or just a dream to me?
I love the flower girl
