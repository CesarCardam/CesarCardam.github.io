68. Spencer Davis Groupalbum
Well, my temperature is rising, got my feet on the floor
Crazy people rocking 'cause they want to some more
Let me in baby, I don't know what you got
But you better take it easy 'cause this place is hot
And I'm so glad you made it, so glad you made it
You got to gimme some lovin', gimme, gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin', gimme, gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin' everyday
Well, I feel so good, everything's getting high
You better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day and I had no work to do
Wait a minute baby, let it happen to you
And I'm so glad we made it, so glad we made it
You got to gimme some lovin', gimme, gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin', gimme, gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin' everyday, yeh
Well, I feel so good, everything's getting high
You better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day nothing went too good
Now I'm gonna relax, buddy everybody should
And I'm so glad we made it, hey hey, so glad we made it
You got to gimme some lovin', gimme, gimme some lovin' woo ooo
Gimme some lovin', gimme, gimme some lovin'
Gimme, gimme, gimme some of your lovin', baby
You know I need it so bad woo ooo
Gimme some of your lovin', baby
