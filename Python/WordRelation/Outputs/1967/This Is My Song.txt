52. Petula Clarkalbum
Why is my heart so light?
Why are the stars so bright?
Why is the sky so blue
Since the hour I met you?
Flowers are smiling bright
Smiling for our delight
Smiling so tenderly
For all the world, you and me
I know why the world is smiling
Smiling so tenderly
It hears the same old story
Through all eternity
Love, this is my song
Here is a song, a serenade to you
The world cannot be wrong
If in this world there is you
I care not what the world may say
Without your love there is no day
So, love, this is my song
Here is a song, a serenade to you
I care not what the world may say
Without your love there is no day
So, love, this is my song
Here is a song, a serenade to you
