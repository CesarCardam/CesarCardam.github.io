Everybody wants you
Everybody wants your love
I'd just like to make
You mine, all mine
(CHORUS)
Na na na na....
Baby, give it up
Give it up
Baby, give it up
Na na na na....
Baby, give it up
Give it up
Baby, give it up
Everybody sees you
Everybody looks and stares
I'd just like to
Make you mine
(CHORUS)
Give it up
(CHORUS)
Everybody wants you
Everybody wants your love
I'd just like to make
You mine, all mine
(CHORUS)
Can you give it
Can you give it
Give it up
Come on, baby
I need your love
Do you know
I want it, baby
Come on, baby
I want your love
Give it up
Some of your love
Come on and play
The game of love
Everybody is in need
Give it up
Come on, baby
I need your love
Can I touch you
Come on, baby, baby
I love you
Can you give it
Give it up.....aA room full of faceless strangers
Here I am again
Suddenly, my eyes meet yours
Looks like I found a friend
Warms up as the night wears on
We're both feeling good
Gonna take it to the end
This time, we're gonna find out
Find out, find out
Just how good it is, yeah
It's a cool kinda love
It's like rain in the
Summertime coming down
Yes, it's a cool kinda love
And cool love, baby
That's what it's all about
You don't have to say
You don't have to say a thing
It's just a feeling that happens
And what that feeling brings
Time ain't gonna change it
It ain't gonna take it away
It's gonna keep right on going
Every night and every day
Every night, every day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Cool kinda love
Like a rain in the
Summertime coming down
Yeah, it's a cool kinda love
Yes, a cool love, baby
That's what it's all about
It's a cool kinda love
It's like rain in the
Summertime coming down, yeah
Yes, cool kinda love
Yes, a cool love, baby
That's what it's all about
It's a cool kinda love
It's a cool kinda love
You know it's a cool
Kinda love....(fade)
