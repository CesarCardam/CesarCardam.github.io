67. Eric ClaptonComplete Clapton
You've been told, so maybe it's time that you learned
You've been sold, maybe it's time that you earned
I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around with my heart
I'll explain, Ifeel like i'm being used
Make it plain, so you don't get confused
I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around with my heart
I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're playing around with my heart
It's time, time for me to let you know
Ain't no crime, no crime to let your feelings show
I can't stand it
You're fooling around, I can't stand it
You're playing around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're playing around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
You're running around, I can't stand it
Running around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around I can't stand it
Playing around, I can't stand it
You're fooling around with my heart
You're fooling around with my heart
My heart
Running around
Fooling around with my heart
Fooling around, I can't stand it
Running around, I can't stand it
Fooling around I can't stand it
Fooling around I can't stand it
Fooling around I can't stand it
Running around I can't stand it
Fooling around I can't stand it
Running around
Running around
Running around
Running around
Running around
