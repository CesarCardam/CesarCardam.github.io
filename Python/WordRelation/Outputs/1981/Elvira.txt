31. Oak Ridge BoysIcon
Eyes that look like heaven, lips like sherry wine
That girl can sure enough make my little light shine
I get a funny feelin' up and down my spine
Cause I know that my elvira's mine
So I'm singin'
Elvira, elvira
My heart's on fire elvira
Giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow
Giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow
Heigh-ho silver, away
Tonight I'm gonna meet her at the hungry house cafe
And I'm gonna give her all the love I can
She's gonna jump and holler 'cause I saved up my last two dollars
We're gonna search and find that preacher man
Now I'm a singin'
Elvira, elvira
My heart's on fire elvira
Giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow
Giddy up oom poppa omm poppa mow mow
Heigh-ho silver, away
