04. John LennonGimme Some Truth
Our life together
Is so precious together
We have grown, we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take a chance and fly away
Somewhere alone
It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over
Starting over
Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over
Starting over
Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well, well darling
It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over
Starting over
Our life together
Is so precious together
We have grown, we have grown
Although our love still is special
Let's take a chance and fly away somewhere
(Over and over and over)
Starting over (over and over and over)
(And over and over and over)
(Over and over and over)
(And over and over and over)
