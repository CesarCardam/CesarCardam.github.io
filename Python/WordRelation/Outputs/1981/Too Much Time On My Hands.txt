54. StyxParadise Theater
Yeah I'm sitting on this barstool
Talking like a damn fool
Got the twelve o'clock news blues
And I've given up hope for the afternoon soaps
And a bottle of cold brew
Is it any wonder I'm not crazy?
Is it any wonder I'm sane at all?
Well I'm so tired of losing I got nothing to do
And all day to do it
I go out cruisin'
But I've no place to go
And all night to get there
Is it any wonder I'm not a criminal?
Is it any wonder I'm not in jail?
Is it any wonder I've got
Too much time on my hands,
It's ticking away with my sanity
I've got too much time on my hands,
it's hard to believe such a calamity
I've got too much time on my hands
and it's ticking away,
ticking away from me
(Too much time on my hands)
It's tick tick tick tick ticking away
(Too much time on my hands)
And I don't know what to do with myself
(Too much time on my hands)
(Solo)
(Too much time on my hands),
(Too much time on my hands),
(Too much time on my hands)
Now I'm a jet fuel genius
I can solve the world's problems
Without even trying
I have dozens of friends and the fun never ends
That is as long as I'm buying
Is it any wonder I'm not the President
Is it any wonder I'm null and void?
Is it any wonder I've got
Too much time on my hands,
It's ticking away with my sanity
I've got too much time on my hands,
it's hard to believe such a calamity
I've got too much time on my hands
and it's ticking away,
ticking away from me
(Too much time on my hands)
Tick tick tick tick ticking away
(Too much time on my hands)
And I don't know what to do with myself
(Too much time on my hands)
Hmm mmm
(Too much time on my hands)
Tick tick tick ticking away
(Too much time on my hands)
Hmm mmm
(Too much time on my hands)
Too much time on my hands
Too much time on my
