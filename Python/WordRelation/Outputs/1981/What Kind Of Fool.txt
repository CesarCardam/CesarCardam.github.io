85. Barbra Streisand & Barry GibbPartners
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
Who's sorry now
There was a world when we were standing still
And for a moment we were separated
And then you found him
You let the stranger in
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now
What, what kind of fool (what kind of fool)
Tears it apart (tears it apart)
Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing you now
Wonderin' why
Where will I be tomorrow
There was a time when we were down and out
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bough break
We let the heartache in
Who's sorry now
Who's sorry now
What, what kind of fool (what kind of fool)
Tears it apart (tears it apart)
Leaving me pain and sorrow
Losing you now
Wondering why
Where will I be tomorrow
Was there a moment when I cut you down
Played around
What have I done
I only apologize
For being as they say, the last to know
It has to show
When someone is in your eyes
What kind of fool (what kind of fool)
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow
What kind of fool
How can I win
Where will I be tomorrow
What, what
What, what, yeah
Don't leave me baby
Where will I go
Where will you be, what have I done?
Oh where will I be so, tell me why
Why why
What kind of fool
