22. A Taste Of HoneyTwice as Sweet
Let's look up as we walk, so that the tears don't spill
Remembering that spring day, that lonely night.
Let's look up as we walk, count the blurry stars
Remembering that summer day, that lonely night.
Happiness is above the clouds,
Happiness is above the skies.
Let's look up as we walk, so that the tears don't spill
Crying as we walk, that lonely night.
Remembering that autumn day, that lonely night.
Sadness is in the shadow of the clouds,
Sadness is in the shadow of the moon.
Let's walk with our head held up so that the tears don't spill,
Crying as we walk, that lonely night.
