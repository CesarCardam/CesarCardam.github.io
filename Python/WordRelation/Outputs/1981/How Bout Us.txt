No sense in draggin' on past our needs
Let's don't keep it hangin' on

Too many lover's hearts lose their dreams
Some people are made for each other
Some people are made for another for life, how 'bout us

How 'bout us
How 'bout us, baby
Some people are made for each other
Some people are made for another for life, how 'bout us
Some people can hold it together
Last through all kinds of weather, tell me, can we
