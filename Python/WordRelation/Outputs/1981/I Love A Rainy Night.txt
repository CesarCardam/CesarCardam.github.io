Well I love a rainy night; I love a rainy night.
I love to hear the thunder;
watch the lightning when I lights up the sky.
You know it makes me feel good.
Well, I love a rainy night; it's such a beautiful sight.
I love to feel the rain on my face;
taste the rain on my lips,
in the moonlight shadows.
Showers wash all my cares away;
I wake up to a sunny day,
'cause I love a rainy night.
Yeah, I love a rainy night.
Well, I love a rainy night.
Well, I love a rainy night, ooh, ooh.
Well I love a rainy night; I love a rainy night.
I love to hear the thunder;
watch the lightning when I lights up the sky.
You know it makes me feel good.
Well, I love a rainy night; it's such a beautiful sight.
I love to feel the rain on my face;
taste the rain on my lips,
in the moonlight shadows.
Puts a song in this heart of mine;
puts a smile on my face ev'ry time,
'cause I love a rainy night.
Yeah, I love a rainy night.
Well, I love a rainy night.
Well, I love a rainy night, ooh, ooh.
Well, I love a rainy night.
Yeah, I love a rainy night.
Well, I love a rainy night.
