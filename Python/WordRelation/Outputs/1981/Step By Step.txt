75. Eddie RabbittIcon
She seems a million miles away.
When she walks by you don't know what to say.
You're gonna make your move; you better make it now
And don't be afraid 'cause love will show you how.
You take that first step: ask her out and treat her like a lady.
Second step: tell her she's the one you're dreaming of.
Third step: take her in your arms and never let her go.
Don't you know step by step; step by step you'll win her love.
She looks too beautiful to touch,
But your heart keeps talking to you.
Now, don't give up.
You think you see something in her eyes,
But you will never know until you try.
But you've got to take that first step:
ask her out and treat her like a lady.
Second step: tell her she's the one you're dreaming of.
Third step: take her in your arms and never let her go.
Don't you know step by step; step by step you'll win her love.
Second step. Third step. Don't you know, step by step; step by step.
