Lady, you bring me up when I'm down,
And maybe you're gonna change my life around
You came to me when I was lonely and no one cared
You made me see that I was only, just runnin' scared
I saw your face and somethin' told me, you were the one
You smiled at me and now I see: my life's begun
Lady, (pretty lady) you bring me up when I'm down,
Up when I'm down
(And maybe you're gonna change my life around)
Gonna change my life around, yeah
Lady, you brought me in from out the rain, yeah
Maybe my life will never be the same
Once I was filled with desperation, a solitary man
You gave me hope and inspiration, like only true love can
Now I believe in what you're sayin', I'm ten feet tall
This love don't need no explainin', we've got it all
(Lady, you bring me up when I'm down)
Up when I'm down
And maybe (Maybe you're gonna change my life around)
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na la la la la la
Whoa lady, you bring me up when I'm down
Up when I'm down
(And maybe, yeah, you're gonna change my life around)
Gonna change my life around, yeah
Lady, pretty lady, you brought me in from out the rain
And maybe my life will never be the same
It'll never be the same, yeah
Lady, woo, you bring me up when I'm down,
Up when I'm down
(And maybe, maybe you're gonna change my life around)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (ooo)
Lady
(Lady, you bring me up when I'm down)
(And maybe you're gonna change my life around woo)
(Lady)
(Woo Lady)
(You bring me up when I'm down)
