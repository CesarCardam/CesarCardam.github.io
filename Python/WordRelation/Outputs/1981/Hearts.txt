41. Marty Balinalbum
Is everything alright I just called to say
How lost I feel without you
Miles away I really can't believe I'm near
And how I still care about you
Hearts can break and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts could cry when love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way
Is everything the same do you ever think of me
And how we loved one another
Will you change your mind will you wander back
Again or have you found yourself a new love
Hearts can break and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts could cry when love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way
Is everything okay I just thought I'd write a song
To tell the world how I miss you
Cause each and every day I think of all the words
I never said and all the chances that I had you
Hearts can break and never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts could cry when love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way
Hearts can be that way
Hearts can be is everything alright
