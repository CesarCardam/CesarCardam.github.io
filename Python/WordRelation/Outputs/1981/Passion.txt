38. Rod StewartTonight&#039;s the Night: Live 1976-1998
Somebody somewhere
In the heat of the night
Looking pretty dangerous
Running out of patience.
Tonight in the city
You won't find any pity
Hearts are being twisted
Another lover cheated, cheated.
In the bars and the cafes
Passion in the streets and the alleys
Passion a lot of pretending
Passion everybody searching passion.
Once in love you're never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah.
Passion passion passion passion
New York, Moscow, passion
Hong Kong, Tokyo, passion
Paris and Bangkok, passion.
A lotta people ain't got, passion.
Hear it on the radio, passion,
Read it in the paper, passion,
Hear it in the churches, passion,
See it in the school yards, Passion.
Once in love you're never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to yeah.
Once in love you're never out of danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to, yeah
Alone in your bed at night, passion,
It's half past midnight, passion
As you turn out your sidelight, passion,
Something ain't right, passion.
There's no passion, there's no passion
There's no passion, I need passion
You need passion, We need passion
Can't live without passion
Won't live without passion
Even the president needs passion
Everybody I know needs some passion
Some people die and kill for passion
Nobody admits they need passion
Some people are scared of passion
Yeah passion
