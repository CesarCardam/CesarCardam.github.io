72. Steely DanThe Definitive Collection
Way back when, in sixty-seven
I was the dandy of gamma chi
Sweet things from Boston
So young and willing
Moved down to Scarsdale
Where the hell am I
Hey nineteen
No we cant dance together
We cant dance together
No we cant talk at all
Please take me along
When you slide on down
Hey nineteen
Thats Retha Franklin
She dont remember the Queen of Soul
Its hard times befallen the sole survivors
She thinks Im crazy
But Im just growin' old
Hey nineteen
No we got nothin' in common
We cant dance together
No we cant talk at all
Please take me along
When you slide on down
Sure looks good
Skate a little lower now
The cuervo gold
The fine Columbian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
Say it again
The cuervo gold
The fine Columbian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
The cuervo gold
The fine Columbian
Make tonight a wonderful thing
No we cant dance together
No we cant talk at all
