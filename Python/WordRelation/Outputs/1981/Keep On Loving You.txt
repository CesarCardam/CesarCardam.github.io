10. REO SpeedwagonThe Box Set Series
You should have seen by the look in my eyes, baby
There was somethin' missin'
You should have known by the tone of my voice, maybe
But you didn't listen
You played dead, but you never bled
Instead you laid still in the grass, all coiled up and hissin'
And though I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us
Baby, way before then, and we're still together
And I meant
Every word I said
When I said that I loved you I meant that I loved you forever
And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do
I don't want to sleep, I just want to keep on lovin' you
And I meant
Every word I said
When I said that I loved you I meant that I loved you forever
And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I want to do
I don't want to sleep, I just want to keep on lovin' you
Baby, I'm gonna keep on loving you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't want to sleep, I just want to keep on lovin' you
