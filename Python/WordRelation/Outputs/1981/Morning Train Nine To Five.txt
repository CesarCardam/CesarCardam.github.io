12. Sheena EastonThe World Of: The Singles Collection
I wake up every mornin', I stumble out of bed
Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead
It seems to last forever, and time goes slowly by
Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly
'Cause the moment that he's with me, time can take a flight
The moment that he's with me, everything's alright
Night time is the right time, we make love
Then it's his and my time, we take off
My baby takes the morning train, he works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again to find me waitin' for him
My baby takes the morning train, he works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again to find me waitin' for him
He takes me to a movie, or to a restaurant, to go
Slow dancing, anything I want
Only when he's with me, I catch light
Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright
My baby takes the morning train, he works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again to find me waitin' for him
All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly
I'm crazy mad for him, and he's crazy mad for me
When he steps off that train, I'm makin' a fool, a fight
Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night
My baby takes the morning train, he works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again to find me waitin' for him
My baby takes the morning train, he works from nine till five and then
He takes another home again to find me waitin' for him
He's always on that morning train
He works so hard
To find me waiting for him
