96. Gary WrightThe Right Place
I don't mind being lonely
But I do mind if not being loved
Maybe you're feeling the same way too
You're ready to hold some one
[Chorus]
I really want to know you
I really want to show you the way I feel
I really want to know you
I really want to show you the way I feel
Something about you is telling me
We're coming from the very same place
It's only just a notion I have
(But) I see it written over your face
[Chorus]
You've got something about you that I want around me
Something I've been searching all my life through
So now it's up to you, yeah, yeah
Tell me what you're gonna do
I want to know yeah yeah yeah
Every time I see you it's the same thing all over again
You're doing something to me it's true
And I don't want to fell it end
[Chorus]
You've got something about you that I want around me
Something I've been searching all my life through
So now it's up to you, yeah, yeah
Tell me what you're gonna do
I want to know yeah yeah yeah
