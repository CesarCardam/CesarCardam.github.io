Givin' it up for your love - everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
Givin' it up for your love - everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
My heart is aching for you, I can't stand it
I need your love, am I so demanding?
I'm givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
I'm Givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
Well I thought about it
you know I'm not playing
You better listen to me
every word I been saying
Hot is cold, what's cold is hot
I' m a little mixed up,
but I'll give it everything I've got
Don't want your money, don't need your car
I'm doing all right, doing all right so far
I'm givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
I'm Givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
I know you told me
that you'd always love me
And I believed it was true
So I saved the best and I'm ready
My love only just for you
Come back here, come back real quick
my body's aching, and my heart is feeling weak
I'll be alright, I'll be OK
Come on baby, listen to what I say
I don't need your money, don't need your car
I'm doing all right, doing all right so far
I'm givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
I'm Givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
I'm givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
I'm Givin' it up for your love everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
