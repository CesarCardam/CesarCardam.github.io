46. Rick Nelsonalbum
I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When i got to the garden party, they all knew my name
No one recognized me, i didn't look the same
[Chorus]
But it's all right now, i learned my lesson well.
You see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself
People came from miles around, everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air
'n' over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in dylan's shoes wearing his disguise
[Chorus]
Lott-in-dah-dah-dah, lot-in-dah-dah-dah
Played them all the old songs, thought that's why they came
No one heard the music, we didn't look the same
I said hello to "mary lou", she belongs to me
When i sang a song about a honky-tonk, it was time to leave
[Chorus]
Lot-dah-dah-dah (lot-dah-dah-dah)
Lot-in-dah-dah-dah
Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped johnny b. goode
Playing guitar like a-ringin' a bell and lookin' like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, i wish you a lotta luck
But if memories were all i sang, i rather drive a truck
[Chorus]
Lot-dah-dah-dah (lot-dah-dah-dah)
Lot-in-dah-dah-dah
'n' it's all right now, learned my lesson well
You see, ya can't please everyone, so you got to please yourself
