67. Donny OsmondThe Entertainer
And they called it puppy love
Oh, I guess they'll never know
How a young heart really feels
And why I love her so
And they called it puppy love
Just because we're in our teens
Tell them all, please tell them it isn't fair
To take away my only dream
I cry each night my tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I'll hope and I'll pray that maybe someday
You'll be back in my arms once again
Someone, help me, help me, help me please
Is the answer up above
How can I, oh how can I tell them
This is not a puppy love
