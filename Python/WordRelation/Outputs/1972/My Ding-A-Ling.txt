(Sing this one with me, Everybody sing this one, I wanna hear everybody join in)
When I was a little bitty boy
My Grandmother bought me a cute little toy
Silver bells hanging on a string
She told me it was my Ding a ling a ling
Oh my ding a ling, Everybody sing
I wanna play with my ding a ling a ling
Oh my ding a ling, my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling a ling
(I forgot to tell you it's a little jerk, Right there, A little jerk in it, Right there, Can't do without that jerk, Yeah)
When I started Grammar School
I used to stop off in the vestibule
Every time that bell would ring
They'd catch me playing with my ding a ling a ling
Oh my ding a ling, Everybody sing
I wanna play with my ding a ling a ling
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling a ling
(Here come that jerk again, Mmh, Does something good to ya)
Humpty Dumpty on the wall
Humpty had an awful fall
When they went to tell the king
Caught him playing with his ding a ling
Oh my ding a ling, my ding a ling
Come on now everybody sing
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling
(Oh yeah, got something to it)
I remember the girl next door
We used to play house on the kitchen floor
I'd be king, she'd be queen
Together we'd play with our ding a ling a ling
My ding a ling, Oh my
I wanna play with my ding a ling a ling
(Mmh)
When they took me to Sunday School
Tried to teach me the golden rule
But every time the choir would sing
Catch me playing with my ding a ling
Oh my ding a ling, my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling
My ding (That's right), my ding a ling
I wanna play with my ding a ling a ling
(You know, I didn't hear everybody singing, Everybody joins in on that chorus)
This here song, it ain't to sad
Cutest little song you ever had
Those of you, who will not sing
You must be playing with your own ding a ling
Oh my ding a ling, my ding a ling (Come on now, Come on now, Everybody sing)
Now my ding a, oh my ding a
I wanna play with my ding a ling
(Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah)
