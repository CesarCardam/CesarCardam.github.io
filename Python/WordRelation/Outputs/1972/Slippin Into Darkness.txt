Ah
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well
Wow, wow, wow (hoo hoo hoo)
I was slippin' into darkness
When they took my friend away
I was slippin' into darkness
When they took, when they took my friend away
You know he loves to drink good whiskey (wo ho ho ho)
While laughing at the moon
Slippin' into darkness
Take my mind beyond the dreams
I was slippin' into darkness, yeah
Take my mind beyond the dreams
Where I talk to my brother (wo ho ho ho)
Who never said their name
Slippin' into darkness, yeah
All my trouble so I choose
I was slippin' into darkness, yeah
All my trouble so I choose
I got a wife and a baby, yeah yeah (oh ho ho ho)
Now my love hath gained its fame, yeah
Slippin' into darkness, yeah
When I heard my mother say
I was slippin' into darkness
When I heard my mother say
Hey, what'd she say what'd she say
You've been slippin' into darkness (wo ho ho ho)
Pretty soon you gonna pay, hey
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
