12. Looking Glassalbum
There's a port on a western bay
And it serves 100 ships a day
Lonely sailors pass the time away
And talk about their lives
And there's a girl in this harbor town
And she works laying whiskey down
They say Brandy, fetch another round
And she serves them whiskey and wine
They say,"Brandy, you're a fine girl
What a good wife you would be
You could steal a sailor
From the sea.
Brandy wears a braided chain
Made of finest silver from the
North of Spain
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy loved.
He came on a summer's day
Bringing gifts from far away
But he made it clear he couldn't stay
No harbor was his home.
Brandy, you've a fine girl,
What a good wife you would be
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea.
Brandy used to watch his eyes
When he told his sailing stories
She could feel the ocean fall and rise
She saw its raging glory,
But he had always told the truth
Lord, he was an honest man
And Brandy does her best to understand.
At night when the bars close down
Brandy walks through a silent town
And loves a man who's not around
She still can hear him say
Brandy, you've a fine girl,
What a good wife you would be
But my life, my love and my lady is the sea.
