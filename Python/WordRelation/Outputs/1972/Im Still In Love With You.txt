59. Al GreenI&#039;m Still in Love with You
Spending my day, thinkin' 'bout you girl
Being here with you, being near with you
I can't explain myself
Why I, feel like I do (like I do)
Though it hurt me so to let you know when I
Look in your eyes, you want to let me know
How you feel
Let me know, that love is really real
But it seems to me
That I'm, wrapped up in your love
Don't you know that I'm
Still in love (Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey
Heaven knows that I'm
Still in love (Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you, hey
And I look in your eyes
And all, and all the years I, I see (I see)
Me lovin' you and you lovin' me
Well it seems to me
That I'm so wrapped up in your love
Don't you know that I'm
Still in love (Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you
I, I, I, I
Don't you know that I'm
Still in love (Still in love, in love with you)
Sho' 'nuff in love with you
Hey I tried, in love with you, I, I
