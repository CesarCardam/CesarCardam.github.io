Ohhh
I thank God for you
(I thank God, I thank God)
You were woman enough, girl not to try to hide
(Didn't try to hide it baby) [Repeat x2]
Didn't try to hide your love
For this other guy, hey
No need to explain
Ohhh
I thank the angels for you
That you were woman enough try to make it easier for me
(Try to make it easy) [Repeat x3]
Where ever, say it, where ever you go
I want you to know, you have but to call on me
And I'll be right by your side
Ohhh
I thank God for you
(I thank God, I thank God)
For it's very nice to see
There's a man who understands how hard it is
(So understanding baby) [Repeat x2]
To take your hand and try to explain
Ohhh
Thank the angels for you
Your the kind of man your are
To be so understanding, well
(So understanding) [Repeat x3]
Where ever you go
You have but to call on me
And I'm gonna be right by your side, yes I will
