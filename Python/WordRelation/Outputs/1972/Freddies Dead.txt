82. Curtis MayfieldSuperfly [TKO]
Freddie's dead
That's what I said
Let the man rap a plan
Said he'd see him home
But his hope was a rope
And he should've known
Everybody's misused him
Ripped him up and abused him
Another junkie plan
Pushing dope for the man
A terrible blow
But that's how it goes
A Freddie's on the corner now
If you want to be a junkie, wow
Remember Freddie's dead
We're all built up with progress
But sometimes I must confess
We can deal with rockets and dreams
But reality, what does it mean
Ain't nothing said
'Cause Freddie's dead
Hey, hey
Love, love
Ha, ha
Love, love
Yeah, yeah
Ha, ha
Love, love
Freddie's dead
All I want is some peace of mind
With a little love I'm trying to find
This could be such a beautiful world
With a wonderful girl
Why I need a woman child
Don't want to be like Freddie now
'Cause Freddie's dead
Everybody's misused him
Ripped him up and abused him
Another junkie plan
Pushing dope for the man
A Freddie's on the corner now
If you want to be a junkie, why
Remember Freddie's dead
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Freddie's dead
