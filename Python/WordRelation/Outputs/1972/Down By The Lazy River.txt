36. OsmondsLive in Las Vegas: 50th Anniversary Reunion Concert
What are ya doin' tonight?
Ya got no place to go.
Gotta get out of the city,
Why don't'cha come along with me?
Mighty fine out tonight,
Getcha girl and hold her tight.
We can take it nice and easy,
You know it won't be long till we'll be, we'll be
Down by the lazy river,
Come as you please.
Down by the lazy river,
One big family.
If you're all alone,
You won't be long.
Just bring your guitar and sing your song.
Down by the lazy river,
Everybody follow me.
Better make up your mind,
Let's get the show on the road.
We're gonna have a party,
Come along or you'll be sorry, sorry.
You know there's plenty of room,
Come on and sing a boom boom boom.
We can get nice and cozy,
Why don'tcha come along and mosey
And down,
I said down,
Come on down,
I'm goin'
Down by the lazy river,
Come as you please.
Down by the lazy river,
One big family.
If you're all alone,
You won't be long.
Just bring your guitar and sing your song.
Down by the lazy river
