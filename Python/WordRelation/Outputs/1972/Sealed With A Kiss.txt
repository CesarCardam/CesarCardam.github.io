'Though we gotta say goodbye, for the summer
Baby I promise you this
I'll send you all my love every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
Yes it's gonna be a cold, lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my dreams every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
I'll see you in the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But baby you won't be there
I don't want to say goodbye, for the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
So let us make a pledge to meet in September
And seal it with a kiss
