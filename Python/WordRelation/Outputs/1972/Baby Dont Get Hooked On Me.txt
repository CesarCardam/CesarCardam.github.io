Girl you're gettin' that look in your eyes,
and it's starting to worry me.
I ain't ready for no family ties,
nobody's gonna hurry me.
Just keep it friendly girl 'cause I don't want to leave,
Don't start clinging to me girl 'cause I can't breathe.
Baby, baby don't get hooked on me.
Baby, baby don't get hooked on me.
'Cause I'll just use you then I'll set you free.
Baby, baby don't get hooked on me.
Girl you're a hot blooded woman, child,
and it's warm where you're touching me.
But I can tell by your tremblin' smile,
you're seeing way too much in me.
Girl don't let your life get tangled up with mine,
'cause I'll just leave you, I can't take no clinging vine.
Baby, baby don't get hooked on me.
Baby, baby don't get hooked on me.
'Cause I'll just use you then I'll set you free.
Baby, baby don't get hooked on me.
