63. Three Dog Nightalbum
The ink is black
The page is white
Together we learn to read and write
A child is black
A child is white
A whole world looks upon the sight
A beautiful sight
And now a child can understand
That this is the law of all the land
All the land
The world is black
The world is white
It turns by day and then by night
A child is black
A child is white
Together they grow to see the light
To see the light
And now at last we plainly see
We'll have a dance of liberty
The world is black
The world is white
It turns by day and then by night
A child is black
A child is white
The whole world looks upon the sight
A beautiful sight
