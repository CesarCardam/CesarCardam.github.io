Well you're dirty and sweet, clad in black
Don't look back and I love you
You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah
Well you're slim and you're weak
You've got the teeth of a hydra upon you
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl.
Get it on, bang the gong, get it on
Get it on, bang the gong, get it on
You're built like a car,
You've got a hub cap diamond star halo
You're built like a car, oh yeah
You're an untamed youth that's the truth
With your cloak full of eagles
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl.
Get it on, bang the gong, get it on
Get it on, bang the gong, get it on
You're windy and wild,
You've got the blues in your shoes and your
Stockings
You're windy and wild, oh yeah
You're built like a car,
You've got a hub cap diamond star halo
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl.
Get it on, bang the gong, get it on
Get it on, bang the gong, get it on
You're dirty and sweet,
Clad in black, don't look back
And I love you
You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah
You dance when you walk so let's dance,
Take a chance, understand me
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl.
Get it on, bang the gong, get it on
Get it on, bang the gong, get it on
