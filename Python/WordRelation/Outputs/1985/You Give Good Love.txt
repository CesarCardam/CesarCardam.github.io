47. Whitney HoustonWhitney Houston
I found out what I've been missing
Always on the run
I've been looking for someone
Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see
That you give good love to me baby
So good take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me baby
Never too much
Baby you give good love
Never stopping I was always searching
For that perfect love
The kind that girls like me dream of
Now you're here like you've been before
And you know just what I need
It took some time for me to see
That you give good love to me baby
So good take this heart of mine into your hands
You give good love to me baby
Never too much
Baby you give good love
Now I've stopped looking around
Each night what this life's all about
Our love is here to stay
Baby you give good love
