45. Phil Collins...Hits
There's this girl that's been on my mind
All the time, Su-Su-Sussudio oh oh
Now she don't even know my name
But I think she likes me just the same
Su-Su-Sussudio oh oh
Ah if she called me I'd be there
I'd come running anywhere
She's all I need, all my life
I feel so good if I just say the word
Su-Su-Sussudio, just say the word
Oh Su-Su-Sussudio
Now I know that I'm too young
My love has just begun
Su-Su-Sussudio oh oh
Oh give me a chance, give me a sign
I'll show her anytime
Su-Su-Sussudio oh oh
Ah, I've just got to have her, have her now
I've got to get closer but I don't know how
She makes me nervous and makes me scared
But I feel so good if I just say the word
Su-Su-Sussudio, just say the word
Oh Su-Su-Sussudio, oh
