55. StingAll This Time
Free, free, set them free.
Free, free, set them free.
Free, free, set them free.
Free, free, set them free.
If you need somebody, call my name.
If you want someone, you can do the same.
If you want to keep something precious,
Got to lock it up and throw away the key.
You want to hold on to your possessions, don't even think about me.
If you love somebody, if you love someone,
If you love somebody, if you love someone set them free.
(Free, free, set them free.)
Set them free.
(Free, free, set them free.)
Set them fee.
(Free, free, set them free.)
Set them free.
(Free, free, set them free.)
If it's a mirror you want just look into my eyes,
Or a whipping boy, someone to despise.
Or a pris'ner in the dark tied up in chains you just can't see
or a beast in a gilded cage; that's all some people ever want to be.
If you love somebody, if you love someone,
If you love somebody, if you love someone set them free.
(Free, free, set them free.)
Set them free.
(Free, free, set them free.)
Set them fee.
(Free, free, set them free.)
Set them free.
(Free, free, set them free.)
You can't control an independent heart,
(Can't love what you can't keep)
Can't tear the one you love apart.
(Can't love what you can't keep)
Forever conditioned to believe that we can't live,
We can't live here and be happy with less.
With so many riches, so many souls,
With ev'rything we see that we want to possess.
If you need somebody, call my name.
If you want someone, you can do the same.
If you want to keep something precious,
Got to lock it up and throw away the key.
You want to hold on to your possessions, don't even think about me.
If you love somebody, if you love someone,
If you love somebody, if you love someone set them free.
(Free, free, set them free.)
Set them free.
(Free, free, set them free.)
Set them fee.
(Free, free, set them free.)
Set them free.
(Free, free, set them free.)
(Free, free, set them free.)
Set them free.
(Free, free, set them free.)
Set them fee.
(Free, free, set them free.)
Set them free.
(Free, free, set them free.)
