71. ABCAbsolutely
The message is perfectly simple
The meaning is clear
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear
No don't disappear
Ever had the feeling almost broke in two?
Said that you were leaving like you do you do?
All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more
In tears in tears
Be near me Be near Be near
Never had that feeling until I first me you
Never felt I like kneeling now I do, yes I do
All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more
In tears in tears
Be near me Be near Be near
What's your reputation?
Ecstasy!
What's you destination?
Next to me
