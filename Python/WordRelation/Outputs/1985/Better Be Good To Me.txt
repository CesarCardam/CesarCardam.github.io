59. Tina TurnerAll The Best
A prisoner of your love
Entangled in your web
Hot whispers in the night
I'm captured by your spell
Oh yes I'm touched by this show of emotion
Should I be fractured by your lack of devotion
Should I, should I?
You better be good to me
That's how it's gotta be now
'Cause I don't have no use
For what you loosely call the truth
And you better be good to me
C'mon c'mon be good to me
I think it's all so right
That we don't need to fight
We stand face to face
And you present your case
Yes I know you keep telling me that you love me
And I really do want to believe
But did you think I'd just accept you in blind faith
Oh sure babe, anything to please you
But you better be good to me
That's how it's gotta be now
'Cause I don't have the time
For your over loaded lines
And you better be good to me
Be good to me
And I really don't see why it's so hard to be good to me
And you know, I don't understand what's your plan, that you can't be good to me
Why can't you be, good to me
Be good, be good to me
'Cause I don't have no use
For what you loosely call the truth
And I don't have the time
For your over loaded lines
But you better be good to me
Be good to me, be good
Be good to me
'Cause I don't have no use
For what you loosely call the truth
And I don't have the time
For your over loaded lines
You better be good to me
Good to me, better be, good to me
Be good, be good to me, good to me
Why can't you be good to me
Why can't you be good to me
C'mon c'mon c'mon
