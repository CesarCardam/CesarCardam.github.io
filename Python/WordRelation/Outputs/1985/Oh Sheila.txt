Like I always say, what's good for the geese
Is always good for the gander
Oh Sheila,
Oh, oh
Oh baby love me right
Let me love you till I get it right, hmm
Can't you let the others be
'Cause with you is where I got to be, yeah
Oh, sugar where you been
Hangin' out with your male friends
Listen, somebody's going to hurt you
The way you love, to keep hurting me,
And we sing
Oh oh Sheila let me love you
Till the morning comes
Oh oh Sheila you know I want
To be the only one
Oh baby, understand that I want
To be the only man
But it seems as though it's getting too hard
And I think I'll start to have my own friend
Oh baby, it's plain to see
That you're qualified to fulfill your needs
You think you pulled one over on me
Well honey, baby, just you wait and see
And we sing
Oh oh Sheila let me love you
Till the morning comes (just tryin' to say)
Oh oh Sheila you know I want
To be the only one (for her)
Oh baby, it's 1-2-3
I love you baby honestly, hmm,

Di a di da li a di a di da li

Let me love you till we get it right, hmm
Can't you let the others be
'Cause with you is where I got to be, yeah
Oh, baby
Understand
That I want to be the only man
You think you pulled one over on me
(Well, honey, baby, just you wait and see)
(And we sing)
