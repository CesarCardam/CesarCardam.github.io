85. DebargeRhythm of the Night
Sometimes a love won't get cold
Hard as I try I know for sure
Everybody is telling me
You'll be over her eventually
But how am I suppose to feel so secure
[Chorus]
When I keep wondering
Who's holding Donna now
When I keep wondering
Who's heart she's knocking around
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To be in his shoes right now
And I keep wondering
Who's holding Donna now
And I keep wondering
What magic can be found
To turn me back to the one
Who's holding Donna now
Her letter started with goodbye
I've read it half a million times
Tell me this is just a dream
When I wake up she'll be hear next to me
Tell me it will be just the way it was
[Chorus]
