82. Bruce SpringsteenBorn In The U.S.A.
Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone, mmm mmm
I got a bad desire
Oh, ho ho, I'm on fire
Tell me now baby is he good to you
And can he do to you the things that I do, oh no
I can take you higher
Oh, ho ho, I'm on fire
Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six inch valley
Through the middle of my soul
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you, can cool my desire
Oh, ho ho, I'm on fire
Oh, ho ho, I'm on fire
Oh, ho ho, I'm on fire
