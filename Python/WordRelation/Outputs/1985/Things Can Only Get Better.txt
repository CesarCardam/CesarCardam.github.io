41. Howard JonesThe Peaceful Tour
We're not scared to lose it all security throw through the wall
Future dreams we have to realize
A thousand skeptic hands won't keep us from the things we plan
Unless we're clinging to the things we prize
And do you feel scared, I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better
Wow wow wow oh, wow wow wow oh oh oh oh
Treating today as though it was the last, the final show
Get to sixty and feel no regret
It may take a little time a lonely path, an uphill climb
Success or failure will not alter it
And do you feel scared, I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better
Wow wow wow oh, wow wow wow oh oh oh oh
And do you feel scared, I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better
(Wow wow wow oh, wow wow wow oh oh oh oh)
(Wow wow wow oh, wow wow wow oh oh oh oh)
