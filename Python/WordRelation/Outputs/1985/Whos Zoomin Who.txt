94. Aretha FranklinThe Real... Aretha Franklin
You walked in on the sly
Scopin' for love
In the crowd, I caught your eye
You can't hide your stuff
You came to catch
You thought I'd be naive and tame
You met your match
I beat you at your own game
(chorus)
Who's zoomin' who, take another look, tell me baby
Who's zoomin who...oh
Who's zoomin' who, now the fish jumped off the hook
Didn't I baby...Who's zoomin' who (repeat)
Guess you believed the world
Played by your rules
Here stands an experienced girl
Nobody's fool...
Don't speculate
you thought you had me covered, but
I've got your bait
You're bound to be my lover...oh
(chorus)
You think you're smooth
That you can pickand choose
When the time is right...
But, just look behind, you'll be surprised to find
I'm gonna make you mine tonight...oh
(chorus)
