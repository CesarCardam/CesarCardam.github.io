Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really really ought to know
Those one track minds
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to shout for joy
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
They gave you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart
I'd really love to break your heart
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
So come on
Shout
Shout
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without

I'm talking to you
Come on

Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
