88. David Lee RothCrazy From The Heat
Well, East coast girls are hip,
I really dig those styles they wear;
And the Southern girls with the way they talk,
They knock me out when I'm down there,
The mid-west farmers daugh-ters
Real-ly make you feel alright,
And the northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night.
Girls (I wish they all could be California)
Girls (I wish they all could be California)
I wish they all could be California Girls
The West coast has the sunshine,
And the girls all get so tanned;
I dig a French bikini on Hawaiian islands,
Dolls by a palm tree in the sand,
I been all around this great big world,
And I've seen all kinds of girls,
But I couldn't wait to get back in the states,
Back to the cutest girls in the world.
Girls (I wish they all could be California)
Girls (I wish they all could be California)
I wish they all could be California Girls
