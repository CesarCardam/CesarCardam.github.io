He said, "Baby, what's wrong with you?
Why don't you use your imagination
Nations go to war over women like you,
It's just a form of appreciation
Come on over here, lay your clothes on the chair
Now let the lace fall across your shoulder
Standing in the half light, you're almost like her
So take it slow like your daddy told you"
Strut pout, put it out, that's what you want from women
Come on baby, what'cha taking me for
Strut pout, cut it out, all taking and no giving
Watch me baby while I walk out the door
I said, "Honey, I don't like this game,
You make me feel like a girl for hire
All this fascination with leather
And lace is just the smoke from another fire"
He said, "Honey, don't stop a speeding train
Before it reaches its destination
Lie down here beside me, oh, have some fun too
Don't turn away from your true vocation"
Strut pout, put it out, that's what you want from women
Come on baby, what'cha taking me for
Strut pout, cut it out, all taking and no giving
Watch me baby while I walk out the door
I won't be your baby doll, be your baby doll
I won't be your baby doll, be your baby doll
