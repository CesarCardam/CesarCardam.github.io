77. Julian Lennonalbum
Ever since you've been leaving me, I've been wanting to cry.
Now I know how it feels for you, I've been wanting to die.
But it's much too late for good-byes, yes, it's much too late for good-byes.
Time has gone since I've been with you, and we've been starting to die.
Now it seems you don't care for me, and I don't understand why.
But it's much too late for good-byes, yes, it's much too late for good-byes.
Ever since you've been far away, I've been wanting to fly.
Now I know what you meant to me, I'm the one who should cry.
And it's much too late for good-byes, yes, it's much too late for good-byes.
Ever since you've been leaving me, I've been wanting to cry.
Now I know how it feels for you, I've been wanting to die.
And it's much too late for good-byes, yes, it's much too late for good-byes.
