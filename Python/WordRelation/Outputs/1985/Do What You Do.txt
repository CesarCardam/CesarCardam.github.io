90. Jermaine Jacksonalbum
Why don't you do what you do
When you did what you did to me
Love was so good, that it fills up all my needs
I was crazy for you, you were crazy for me
How could something so right, go so wrong
My love, sweet love
Why don't you say what you say
When you say what you said anymore
Your eyes couldn't lie, so long goodbye, close the door
I was crazy for you, you were crazy for me
How could something so right go so wrong
Tell me something I didn't do
Why did someone else put you through
Did they steal you away like a thief in the night
Love like this, must take flight
Why don't they play what they played
On the nights you danced with me
Remember the one we made love to endlessly
I was crazy for you, you were crazy for me
How could something so right go so wrong
