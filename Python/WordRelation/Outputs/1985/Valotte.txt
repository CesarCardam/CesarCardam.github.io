78. Julian Lennonalbum
Sitting on the doorstep of the house I can't afford
I can feel you there
Thinking of a reason, well, it's really not very hard
to love you even though you nearly lost my heart
How can I explain the meaning of our love
It fits so tight, closer than a glove
[ Chorus ]
Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
Wonderin' if we're really ever gonna get that far
Do you know there's something wrong
'Cause I've felt it all along
I can see you face in the mirrors of my mind
Will you still be there
We're really not so clever as we seem to think we are
We've always got our troubles
So we'll solve them at the bar
The days go by, we seem to drift apart
If I could only find a way to keep hold of your heart
[ Repeat chorus ]
Sitting in the valley as I watch the sun go down
I can see you there
Thinking of a reason, well, it's really not very hard
to love you though you nearly lost my heart
When will we know when the change is gonna come
I've got a good feeling and it's coming from the sun
Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
Wonderin' if we're really ever gonna get that far
Do you know there's something wrong
We'll stick together 'cause we're strong
