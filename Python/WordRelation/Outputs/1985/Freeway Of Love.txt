43. Aretha FranklinThe Queen of Soul
Knew you'd be a vision in white
How'd you get your pants so tight?
Don't know what you're doin'
But you must be livin' right, yeah
Oh, we got some places to see
I brought all the maps with me
So jump right in, it ain't no sin
Take a ride in my machine
City traffic movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go, go
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac?
Never you mind the exit signs
We got lots of time
We can't quit 'til we get
To the other side, ide, ide
With the radio playin' our song
We keep rollin' along
Who knows how far our car can get
Before you think your love slowin' on down
City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go come on now, go
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our backs
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac? Oh yeah
Here we go, one more time mmm
With the wind and your fingers in my hair
Kind of think we're going for an extended throw down
So drop the top baby
And let's cruise on into this better than ever street
City traffic's movin' way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go, come on baby, go, do it for me now
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We goin' ridin' on the freeway of love
Wind's against my back
Ain't we ridin' on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac?
What I want you to do baby
Get over to the left lane
And let's merge with peace, oh yeah
Take the love that's sent ya
And then in the right time
Go on over in love and satisfaction and joy, well
Ain't we riding babe, ain't we cruising down
Free, free, sweet
Go on after, awh let's be good to each other street
Well, see that little landmark over there
A whole lot of kisses and sweet stuff
We'll be just about, awh, awh, awh
And satisfaction road yeah, satisfaction yeah ooo ahhh
