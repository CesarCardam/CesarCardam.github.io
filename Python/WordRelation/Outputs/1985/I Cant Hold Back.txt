73. SurvivorThe Definitive Collection
There's a story in my eyes
Turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire
I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
I've been holding back the night
I've been searching for a clue from you
I'm gonna try with all my might
To make this story line come true
Can ya feel me tremble when we touch
Can ya feel the hand of fate
Reaching out to both of us
This love affair can't wait
I can't hold back, I'm on the edge
(I can't hold back)
You voice explodes inside my head
I can't hold back, I won't back down
Girl it's too late to turn back now
Another shooting star goes by
And in the night the silence speaks to you and I
And now the time has come at last
Don't let the moment run too fast
I can feel you tremble when we touch
And I feel the hand of fate reaching out to both of us
There's a story in my eyes, turn the pages of desire
Now it's time to trade those dreams
For the rush of passion's fire
I can't hold back, I'm on the edge
(I can't hold back)
You voice explodes inside my head
I can't hold back, I won't back down
Girl it's too late to turn back now
