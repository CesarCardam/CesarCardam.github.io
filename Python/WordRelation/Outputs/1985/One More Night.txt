33. Phil CollinsLove Songs: A Compilation Old &amp; New
One more night
One more night
I've been trying ooh so long to let you know
Let you know how I feel
And if I stumble if I fall, just help me back
So I can make you see
Please give me one more night
Give me one more night
One more night 'cause I can't wait forever
Give me just one more night, oh just one more night
Oh one more night 'cause I can't wait forever
