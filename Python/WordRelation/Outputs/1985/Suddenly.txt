52. Billy Oceanalbum
I used to think that love was just a fairy tale
Until that first hello until that first smile
But if I had to do it all again I wouldn't change a thing
Cause this love is everlasting
Suddenly life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above and things we never take notice of
You wake up suddenly you're in love
Girl you're everything a man could want and more
One thousand words are not enough to say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before now you're all I'm living for
Each day I pray this love affair would last forever
