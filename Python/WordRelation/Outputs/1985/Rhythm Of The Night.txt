32. DebargeRhythm of the Night
When it feels like
The world is on your shoulders
And all of the madness
Has got you goin' crazy
It's time to get out
Step out into the street
Where all of the action
Is right there at your feet
Well
I know a place where we can
Dance the whole night away
Underneath the electric stars
Just come with me and we can
Shake your blues right away
You'll be doin fine once the music starts, oh!
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind
We can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Oh the rhythm of the night, oh yeah
Look out on the street now
The party's just beginning
The music's playing
A celebration's starting
Under the streetlights
The scene is being set
A night for romance
A night you won't forget, so
Come join the fun
This ain't no time to be staying home
Ooh, there's too much going on, oh!
Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known
We're gonna have a good time the whole night long, oh!
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind
You can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Oh, the rhythm of the night, oh yeah
Come join the fun
This ain't no time to be staying home
Ooh, there's too much going on, oh!
Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known
We're gonna have a good time the whole night long, oh!
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind
You can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Forget about the worries on your mind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Forget about the worries on your mind
La la la la
La la la, la la la la
La la la la
The music's playin!
It's a celebration!
The music's playin, everybody dance!
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Forget about the worries on your mind
'Cause you can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind
You can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
