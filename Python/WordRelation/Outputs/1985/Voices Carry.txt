68. 'Til Tuesdayalbum
In the dark, I like to read his mind
But I'm frightened of the things I might find
Oh, there must be something he's thinking of
To tear him away-ay-ay
When I tell him that I'm falling in love
Why does he say-ay-ay
Hush, hush
Keep it down now
Voices carry
Hush, hush
Keep it down now
Voices carry
Uh-uh
I tried so hard not to get upset
Because I know all the trouble I'll get
Oh, he tells me tears are something to hide
And something to fear
And I try so hard to keep it inside
So no one can hear
Hush, hush
Keep it down now
Voices carry
Hush, hush
Keep it down now
Voices carry
Hush, hush
Keep it down now
Voices carry
Uh-uh
Oh, he wants me
But only part of the time
He wants me
If he can keep me in line
Hush, hush
Keep it down now
Voices carry
Hush, hush
Keep it down now
Voices carry
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Hush, hush
So shut up now
Voices carry
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Hush, hush
Keep it down now
Voices carry
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, hush, hush, darling
She might overhear
Hush, hush
Voices carry
He said, "Shut up"
He said, "Shut up"
Oh, God, can't you keep it down?
Voices carry
Hush, hush
Voices carry
I wish he would let me talk
