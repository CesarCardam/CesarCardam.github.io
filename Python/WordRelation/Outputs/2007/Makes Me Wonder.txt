13. Maroon 5It Won&#039;t Be Soon Before Long
I wake up, with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
Feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath, after that
After that
Try to get you back
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah, so this is goodbye
God damn, my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind; make your move
Forget about the truth
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try (yeah)
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
I've been here before
One day I'll wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning
'Cause...
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I...
And so this is goodbye
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true
Anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
So this is goodbye, yeah
So this is goodbye, yeah
So this is goodbye, yeah
