85. Rihanna & Sean Paulalbum
[Rihanna]
The first time you kissed my lips
The first time your finger tips
Touchin' me, couldn't resist
The first, the first, the first
The first time you kissed my lips
The first time your finger tips
Touchin' me, couldn't resist
I knew I was meant for this
The first time you held me close
The first time I couldn't say no
So lost inside of you
I knew I was met for you
[Fabolous]
Now, my first time checkin' you, only took a second to
Start inspectin' you without disrespectin' you
Wasn't expectin' you to say it was affectin' you
What you wearin' got me starin' like you butt-naked, boo
It may seem like I don't even reckon you
But I day dream about kissin' on the neck of you
Style is impeccable, smile is incredible
Ain't nothin' like ya, and, baby, I done met a few you
The way I feel - it's almost like crush (crush)
My heart beats faster - it's almost like a rush (rush)
And that's just when you enter in a room
I could tell when you around by the scent of ya perfume
I see why they put these R and B songs together
I feel like Mariah: "We belong together"
It's my pleasure; I treasure that I met ya
Bet ya I could get ya on the first time
[Rihanna]
The first time you kissed my lips
The first time your finger tips
Touchin' me, couldn't resist
I knew I was meant for this
The first time you held me close
The first time I couldn't say no
So lost inside of you
I knew I was met for you
[Fabolous]
Now, I remember datin'; the first time was intimidatin'
No rush, though, I spent the whole November waitin'
Come on, look at the patience that I'm demonstratin'
After a week or two I usually start eliminatin'
But we got through the convo on the phone
Now we finally chillin' on a condo all alone
I tried to be expressive without bein' aggressive
Just bein' suggestive, a lil' more impressive
And I'm a good player: I listen to the coach
He show me the play book, and said this is the approach
If you ever wanna score, 'cause some players rush they shots
And that's why they never on the floor
And that's why we both feelin' comfortable
Like long-time friends, only been a month or two
I got moves, and I know when to make 'em, but
I only give 'em if I know you could take 'em (uh oh)
[Rihanna]
The first time you kissed my lips
The first time your finger tips
Touchin' me, couldn't resist
I knew I was meant for this
The first time you held me close
The first time I couldn't say no
So lost inside of you
I knew I was met for you
[Fabolous]
Now before the first time we laid down in the bed
You ain't know the kind of thing that played around in my head
I ain't play around when I said you gon' 'member this
Might even turn yourself on when you reminisce
Our first time we were like virgins with experience
A little shy but I urged you to experiment
Things got wetta, oh, I mean betta, oh, I'm gettin' numb
I'm about c-c-c-come on now, not yet, boo, slow down
We just stepped in the ring, need a few more rounds
That's the first time it felt like that
Now you know why Fabolous is spelled like that, yeah
[Rihanna]
The first time you kissed my lips
The first time your finger tips
Touchin' me, couldn't resist
I knew I was meant for this
The first time you held me close
The first time I couldn't say no
So lost inside of you
I knew I was met for you
The first time you kissed my lips
The first time your finger tips
Touchin' me, couldn't resist
I knew I was meant for this
The first time you held me close
The first time I couldn't say no
So lost inside of you
I knew I was met for you
