(Four, tres, two, uno)
Listen up, y'all, 'cause this is it
The beat that I'm bangin' is de-li-cious
Fergalicious definition make them boys go loco
They want my treasure, so they get their pleasures from my photo
You could see me, you can't squeeze me
I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy
I got reasons why I tease 'em
Boys just come and go like seasons
Fergalicious (so delicious)
But I ain't promiscuous
And if you was suspicious
All that shit is fictitious
I blow kisses (mwah)
That puts them boys on rock, rock
And they be lining down the block just to watch what I got (four, tres, two, uno)
So delicious aye aye aye(It's hot, hot)
It's so delicious aye aye aye(I put them boys on rock, rock)
It's so delicious aye aye aye (They wanna taste of what I got)
I'm Fergalicious (t-t-t-t-t-tasty, tasty)
Fergalicious def-, fergalicious def-, fergalicious def
Fergalicious definition make them boys go crazy
They always claim they know me
Comin' to me, callin' me Stacy (Hey, Stacy)
I'm the F to the E, R, G the I the E
And can't no other lady put it down like me
I'm Fergalicious (so delicious)
My body stay vicious
I be up in the gym just working on my fitness
He's my witness (oh, wee)
I put yo' boy on rock, rock
And he be lining down the block just to watch what I got (four, tres, two, uno)
So delicious (It's hot, hot)
So delicious (I put them boys on rock, rock)
So delicious (They wanna taste of what I got)
I'm Fergalicious (hold, hold, hold up, check it out)
Baby, baby, baby

Honey, get some patience
Maybe then you'll get a taste
I'll be tasty, tasty
I'll be laced with lacy
It's so tasty, tasty

All the time I turn around brothas gather round
Always looking at me up and down looking at my (uh)
I just wanna say it
Now, I ain't tryin' to round up drama, little mama
I don't wanna take your man
And I know I'm comin' off just a little bit conceited
And I keep on repeating how the boys wanna eat it
But I'm tryin' to tell that I can't be treated like clientele
Cause they say she
Delicious (so delicious)
But I ain't promiscuous
And if you was suspicious
All that shit is fictitious
I blow kisses (mwah)
That puts them boys on rock, rock
And they be lining down the block just to watch what I got (got, got, got)
