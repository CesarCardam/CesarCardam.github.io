08. Akon Featuring Snoop Doggalbum
Konvict, music and you know we a front
I see you windin' n' grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you, and you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
Money in the air as mo' fair
grab you by your coat tail
Take you to the motel 'ho sale
Don't tell, won't tell
Baby said I don't talk dog, but she told on me, oh well
Take a picture wit' me
What the flick gon' do
Baby, stick to me and I'm a stick on you
If you pick me then I'm a pick on you
D-O-double G, and I'm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy, n' yours is right
Rip-ridin' them poles, and them doors is tight
And I'm a get me a shot before the end of the night
'Cause pussy is pussy and, baby I'm pussy for life
I see you windin' n' grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you, and you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
Shorty, I can see you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas, n' they all got cheese
So you lookin' at me, now what's it gonna be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryin' get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' bout thirty stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub
You know my pedigree,
Ex-deala, use to move 'phetamines
Girl I, spend money like it don't mean nothin',
An' besides I got a thing for you
I see you windin' n' grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you, and you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
Mobbin' through club in the low-pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smokers section (just smokin')
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (Baby, I see you)
It's cool, we jet, the mood is set
Your pussy is wet you rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' n' jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin' you smilin', n' grinin', n' lookin' at me
Girl, n' while you're looking at me, I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio, move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everythin' n' that's kinda scary
Cause I'm lovin' the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast, but I got a thing for you
I see you windin' n' grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you, and you already know
I wanna fuck you, love you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, love you, you already know
I see you windin' n' grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you, and you already know
I wanna fuck you, love you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, love you, you already know girl
