I was blown away, what could I say?
It all seemed to make sense
You've taken away everything
And I can't do without, I try to see the good in life
But good things in life are hard to find
Blow it away, blow it away
Can we make this something good?
Well, I tried to do it right this time around
Let's start over, I tried to do it right this time around, it's not over
There's a part of me that's dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one, it's not over
Taken all I could take, and I can not wait
We're wasting too much time
Being strong, holding on
Can't let it bring us down
My life with you means everything
So I won't give up that easily
Blow it away, blow it away
Can we make this something good?
'Cause it's all misunderstood
Well, I tried to do it right this time around
Let's start over, I tried to do it right this time around
It's not over, 'cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one, it's not over
We can't let this get away
Let it out, let it out
Don't get caught up in yourself, let it out
Let's start over
I tried to do it right this time around, it's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over, let's start over
It's not over, oh yeah, yeah!
This love is killing me, but you're the only one, it's not over
