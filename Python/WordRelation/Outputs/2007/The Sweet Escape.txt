03. Gwen Stefani Featuring AkonThe Sweet Escape
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
If I could escape
I would, but first of all let me say
I must apologize for acting, stinking, treating you this way
Cause I've been acting like sour milk that fell on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold
If I could escape
And recreate a place as my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?
If I could be sweet
I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
(Forever) We can make it better
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?
(Sweet escape)
Woo hoo, (I wanna get away) yee hoo
Woo hoo, (to our sweet escape) yee hoo
Woo hoo, (I wanna get away) yee hoo
Woo hoo, (yeah) yee hoo
You let me down
I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground
So, baby, times getting a little crazy
I've been getting a little lazy
Waiting for you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way the you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me
Want to take you with me
If I could escape
And recreate a place as my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?
If I could be sweet
I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
(Forever) We can make it better
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?
(Sweet escape)
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, (if I could escape) yee hoo
Woo hoo, (if I could escape) yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Cause I've been acting like sour milk that fell on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold
If I could escape
And recreate a place in my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?
If I could be sweet
I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
(Forever) We can make it better
Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)
Woo hoo, (I wanna get away) yee hoo
Woo hoo, (to our sweet escape) yee hoo
Woo hoo, (I wanna get away) yee hoo
Woo hoo, (yeah) yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
