94. Florida Georgia LineHere&#039;s To The Good Times
Strawberry shimmer on hot lips, silver buckle hangin' off her hips
I sparkle when she smiles, shine down on the radio dial
Homemade jar, lemmon drop take a sip. Don't stop girl, you know I love it when you
Get your shine on
You an me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on,shine on-baby get your shine on
Silverado, candy painted, Ray Ban's got the whole world shaded. Chrome piece tucked in the console
Ridin' high, roll up on the down low
Feelin' lucky, got hooked up with some Kentucky, clear
So slide that little sugar shaker over here and
Get your shine on,
You an me be rockin' all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on
Baby get your shine on, shine on
Baby get your shine on
Homeade jar, lemmon drop, take a sip. Don't stop girl, you know I love it when you get your shine on
You and me be rocking all night long
Summer sky drippin' rhinestones, turn your party lights on. Baby get your shine on-shine on
Baby get your shine on, cause you and me be rocking all night long.Summer sky drippin' rhinestones turn your party lights on.
Baby get your shine on shine on
Baby get your shine on(x2)
Strawberry shimmer on hot lips, silver buckle hangin' off her hips I sparkle when she smiles, shine down on the radio dial. Silverado, candy painted, Ray Ban's got the whole worlds shaded. Chromed piece tucked into the console, ridin' high, roll up on the down low.
Baby get your shine on.
