25. AWOLNATIONMegalithic Symphony
Sail
This is how I show my love
I made it in my mind because
Blame it on my ADD baby
This is how an angel dies
Blame it on my own sick pride
Blame it on my ADD baby
Sail, sail
Sail, sail, sail
Maybe I should cry for help
Maybe I should kill myself (myself)
Blame it on my ADD baby
Maybe I'm a different breed
Maybe I'm not listening
So blame it on my ADD baby
Sail, sail
Sail, sail, sail
La la la la la la, la la la la la la
la la la la la la, la la la la la la
Sail, sail
Sail, sail
Sail, sail
Sail, sail, sail
