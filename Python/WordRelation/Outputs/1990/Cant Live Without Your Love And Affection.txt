27. Nelson Lightning Strikes Twice
Here she comes, just like an angel.
Seems like forever that she's been on my mind,
But nothing has changed;
She thinks I'm a waste of her time.
There she goes; she don't know what she's missing.
Can't she see I'll never give up the fight?
I'll do all I can till she understands my desire.
I'm on the outside lookin' in
Let me into your heart - oh,
There's nothing on Earth that
Should keep us apart.
I can't live without your love and affection.
I can't face another night on my own.
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone,
'Cause I can't live without your love.
So I wait, here for an answer,
And wonder if tomorrow will be like yesterday.
I'll keep holding on,
But I can't go on living this way.
I've been on the outside looking in.
Bring these tears to an end - oh,
I realize there's no use for me to pretend.
Oh yeah,
I can't live without your love and affection.
I can't face another night on my own.
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone,
'Cause I can't live without your love.
For your love... I'd put my arms around you.
For your love... and find the strength to tell you.
I can't live without your love and affection.
I just can't go on this way anymore.
As hard as I try there's one thing that I know for sure:
I can't live without your love.
I can't live without your love.
