98. Prince The Hits 1
Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight
They don't care where they kick
Just as long as they hurt you
There are thieves in the temple tonight
Love if you're there come save me
From all this cold despair
I can hang when you're around
But I'll surely die
If you're not there
Love come quick
Love come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple tonight
I feel like I'm looking for my soul (Soul)
Like a poor man looking for gold (Gold)
There are thieves in the temple tonight
