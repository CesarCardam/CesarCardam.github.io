89. Keith Sweat album
Ooh baby, give it to me now, girl
Can't nobody give it out
For me and you, yeah girl
I want to pull down the shades and the lights
And do what I want to do to hear it girl
You can tell me now baby
I can't keep trying to play nice together
Oh girl before the night is over
I bet, I bet I can make you sweat
[[CHORUS]]
You say no, I say yes
Girl I bet, I can make you sweat
You say no, I say yes
Girl I bet, I can make you sweat
I want it right now...
If you let me kiss you here and now
I'll do anything you want me to
I want to drive you wild, baby
Let me tell you, let me drive you wild, babe
[[CHORUS]]
All alone tonight just me and you
I want to do you right
And baby that's what I want to do
Just put your arms in the air
And I'll kiss you everywhere
[[CHORUS WITH AD LIBS]]
Come on baby
You're doing something to me baby
You're doing something right to me baby
Do you find that you're crazy about me?
Yes...yes...yes...yes...yes...
Make you sweat all night long, girl
Just you and me, come on
Just right now baby, do it now
Come on, come on baby, do it now
Right now, but it's you, you, you all night long
Baby there's nobody here but me and you girl
I want to do it girl
I want to do it, do it, do it, do it with you girl
Nobody else, nobody but you
(You say no) Don't tell me now
(Girl I bet) You better tell me now, now baby
(You say no) Ooh girl, I want it girl, yes
(Girl I bet) Ooh girl, I want it right now girl
