65. Pebbles Always
Lately I've been trying to figure out your mind
And why condition me poor little me
And why you have a change of heart turn it all around and then
Try to put it on me poor little me
Don't ya know I can make ya trip I can make things hard
But baby I believe that you've still got a heart that's why
I try to stop myself before I start 'cause I can make it tough
I can make it rough but won't
[Chorus]
And I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
Giving you a minute to try to work it all out
And I'll be giving you the benefit of the doubt
And I'll be giving you a minute to try to work it all out
Baby work it all work it all out
(Work, work, work)
Baby work it all work it all out
(Work, work, work) oooohh
Baby how could you be hangin' out on a diamond queen
Ain't you missin' me poor little me
When you knew all the time that you could have been
With your home girl lovin' and a
Kissin' on sweet little me
Don't you know if you want to be a man you
Gotta work real hard
If you want to make me feel like I'm your number one then
Nothin' in the world should make us part
'Cause we can make it work if you
Take it with the hurt from the heart
[Chorus]
Baby work it all work it all out
(Work, work, work)
Work it baby (work, work, work)
Keep tryin' to work it all out
I can make you trip but I choose not to
Inside of you I think there's still good in you boy
Don't gimmie no reason not to trust you
Just take the benefit don't gimme no lip and I'll be sweet to you
(1-2-3-4) Try to understand you right boy So you need some time (time) to
Work it out work it work it There's really no need to fuss and fight no
All I want is for you to try and work it out (1-2-3-4)
[Chorus]
(I'll be giving) I want to give it
Giving you the benefit
I want to give it giving you the benefit
(I'll be giving I want to give it giving you the benefit
I want to give it giving you the benefit
I'll be giving you a minute or two to try and work it out
But don't you take too long baby
