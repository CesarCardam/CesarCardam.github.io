17. Maxi Priest Bonafide
She was a Jezebel
This burstin' queen
Livin' her life
Like a bad sweet dream
Tellin' me lies
When the truth was clear
I think she knew
What I wanted to hear
Spinnin' around
Like a wheel on fire
Walkin' the tightrope
On love's highwire
A fatal attraction
Is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me
[Chorus]
I just want to be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just want to be close to you
And show you the way I feel
I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you's just like a dream
Love is never what it seems
When we touch
And you're holdin' me the way you feel
Girl you make my dreams come true
You make my dreams come true
[Chorus]
She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars
She holds me back but she goes too far
Windin' me up just to let me down
So emotional gagged and bound
There's more to this than meets the eye
A devil woman locked inside
With the formal rising I was scared
I think I was possessed
[Chorus]
I feel love
Everytime your body's next to mine
Somethin' deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly
When we touch
Girl, you don't know
How it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real!
[Chorus]
She had an attitude I can't explain
You never know if your in flame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on a countdown till I get hurt
Her blood was hot she burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar
[Repeat: x3]
I just want to be close to you
She was a Jezebel
This burstin' queen
Livin' her life
Like a bad sweet dream
Tellin' me lies
When the truth was clear
I think she knew
What I wanted to hear
Spinnin' around
Like a wheel on fire
Walkin' the tightrope
On love's highwire
A fatal attraction
Is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me
I want to be close to you!
And do all the things you want me to
I just want to be close to you (i just want to be close to you baby)
And show you the way I feel
[Chorus]
