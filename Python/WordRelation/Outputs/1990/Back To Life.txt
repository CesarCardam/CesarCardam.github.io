42. Soul II Soul Volume IV: Classic Singles 1988-1993
Back to life, back to reality ( x3)
Back to the here and now yeah
Show me how, decide what you want from me
Tell me may be
I could be there for you
However do you want me,
However do you need me
How, however do you want me,
However do you need me.
Back to life, back to the present time,
Back from a fantasy
Yeah, tell me now, take the iniative
I'll leave it in your hands until you're ready oh
However do you want me,
However do you need me
How, however do you want me
However do you need me,
However do you want me
However do you need me
How, however do you want me
However do you need me (x5)
I live at the top of the block,
No more room for trouble or fuss
Need a change, a positive change look
Look it's me writing on the wall
However do you want
However do you
Back to life, back to the day we have
Let's end this foolish game
Hear me out don't let me waste away
Make up your mind so
I know where I stand
