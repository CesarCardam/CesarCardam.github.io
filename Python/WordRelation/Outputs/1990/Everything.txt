41. Jody Watley The Best Of Jody Watley
Lately I feel so alone
can't find the joy
You know that Id be with you now
If I had the choice
I know I hurt you when I said goodbye
And I don't know the reason I ever stopped believin
I never needed anyone but you
CHORUS
I was too blind to see
When you belonged to me
You were my everything
Now Id give anything
To feel the love you bring
You were my everything
They say time can mend a broken heart
Can fix you up
But my life will never ever be the same
Without your touch
I know you're still afraid to let me in
And I don't blame you really
I wouldn't let you see me
I took for granted you would always be there
CHORUS
I know I hurt you when I said goodbye
And I don't know the reason I ever stopped believin
I never needed anyone but you
CHORUS
