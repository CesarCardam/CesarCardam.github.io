54. After 7 album
I'll give the sun
The rain
The moon
The stars and the mountains
I'll give you the world
And all that you wish for
And even more
Girl I love you more than you could know
And that's for sure
I'd climb the highest hill
Cross the widest sea
Nothin' could discourage me
And I pray that you will be
Always there for me
Forever more
Ready or not
I'll give you everything
And more
All that I've got it's yours
I'll give you everything
All that you're looking for
I'll give you my heart
My soul
My time
My love is a fountain
I will be your earth
And all that you need for
And even more
'Cause girl I love you more than words can show
My love is pure
I'll walk a thousand miles
Sail a thousand seas
Nothin' will discourage me
And I pray that you will
Always be there for me
Forever more
