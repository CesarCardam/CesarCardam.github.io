I've got the power
I've got the power
Hey, yeah!
Like the crack of the whip, I Snap attack
Front to back, in this thing called rap
Dinging like a cymbal, rhyme devil on the heavenly level
Bang the bass, turn up the treble
Radical mind, day and night all the time
Seven, fourteen wise divine
Maniac brainiac, winning the game
I'm the lyrical Jesse James
Quality I possess and say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the microphone, that I am holding
Copy written lyrics, so they can't be stolen
If they all Snap, don't need the police
To try to save them, your voice don't see
So peace, stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
It's getting, it's getting, it's gettin kinda hectic
It's getting, it's getting, it's gettin kinda hectic
It's getting, it's getting, it's gettin kinda hectic
It's getting, it's getting, it's gettin kinda hectic
Quality I possess, and say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the microphone, that I am holding
Copy written lyrics, so they can't be stolen
If they all Snap, don't need the police
To try to save them, your voice don't see
So peace, stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
