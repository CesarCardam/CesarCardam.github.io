60. After 7 album
Last night, I had the time of my life
It's true
For last night, I made love for the very
First time
With you
I never knew love could be so sweet
It never made a difference to me
But ever since the day that you appeared
I'm telling you made the difference
Now love is so clear
And I can't stop (Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
We diggin' on we
And Oh I can't stop (Can't Stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
Last night, you bought something special
Out of me
And for the first time
You made my dream a reality
I never though love was meant for me
For I was blind and could not see
You bought about a love that's so sincere
And I'm telling you, you've made the
Difference
Now love is so sincere
And I can't stop (Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
We diggin' on we
And Oh I can't stop (Can't Stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
And I can't stop (Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
We diggin' on we
And Oh I can't stop (Can't Stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
And I can't stop (Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
We diggin' on we
And Oh I can't stop (Can't Stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
You've got me thinking that I need
Protection
Cause your love is so strong
I don't want to do wrong
Girl your love seems like it's true
Protection
You just give me a call
And I'll give you my all
And I can't stop (Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
We diggin' on we
And Oh I can't stop (Can't Stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin' on you
You diggin' on me
