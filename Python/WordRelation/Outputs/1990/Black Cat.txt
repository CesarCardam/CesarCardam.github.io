59. Janet Jackson Rhythm Nation 1814
One, two, three, four
All the lonely nights I spend alone
Never 'round to love me
You're always gone
'Cause you're hangin' out
Breakin' the rules
Oh the man has come
Lookin' for you
You're a rebel now
Don't give a damn
Always carrying on
With the gang
I'm tryin' to tell ya boy
It's a mistake
You won't realize
'Til it's too late
Don't understand
Why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies
Black cat nine lives
Short days long nights
Livin' on the edge
Not afraid to die
Heart beat real strong
But not for long
Better watch your step
Or you're gonna die
You're so together boy
But just at a glance
You'll do anything
If given the chance
Scheming, plannin' lies
To get what you need
So full of promises
That you never keep
Don't you tell yourself
That it's okay
Sick and tired of
All of your games
And you want me to stay
(Aww) Better change
Makes no sense to me
Your crazy ways
Don't understand
Why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies
Not afraid to die
Black cat
Black cat
Short days long nights
Livin' on the edge
Don't understand
Why you insist
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies
Black cat nine lives
Short days long nights
Livin' on the edge
Not afraid to die
Heart beat real strong
But not for long
Better watch your step
Or you're gonna die
Black cat nine lives
Short days long nights
Livin' on the edge
Not afraid to die
Heart beat real strong
But not for long
Better watch your step
Or you're gonna die
