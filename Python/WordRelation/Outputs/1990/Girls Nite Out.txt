Get up! Get up! Get up!
Get up! Get up! Get up!
Ni ni ni ni ni ni, ni ni nite Get up!
Ni ni ni ni ni ni, ni ni nite Get up!
I'm sick and tired of being left at home
while the boys go out and leave us all alone, yeah.
I want to go out with my girlfriends and party all night.
And this time, you can't change my mind.
I've got my mind made up, so don't wait up for me.
The time has come for the boys to realize
that it's our turn to have some fun, and it's gonna be tonight.
It's the girls night out, ni ni nite out, and there's nothing you can say,
baby. It's the girls night to play,
our night to play, so don't wait up for me.
I'm sick and tired of being left at home
while the boys go out and leave us all alone, yeah.
I want to go out with my girlfriends and party all night.
And this time, you can't change my mind.
I've got my mind made up, so don't wait up for me.
Get up! Get up! Get up!
Get up! Get up! Get up!
Ni ni ni ni ni ni, ni ni nite Get up!
Ni ni ni ni ni ni, ni ni nite Get up!
Get up! Get up! Get up!
Get up! Get up! Get up!
Ni ni ni ni ni ni, ni ni nite Get up!
Ni ni ni ni ni ni, ni ni nite Get up!
Get up! Get up! Get up!
Get up! Get up! Get up!
Ni ni ni ni ni ni, ni ni nite Get up!
Ni ni ni ni ni ni, ni ni nite Get up!
