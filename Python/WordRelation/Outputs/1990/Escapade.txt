15. Janet Jackson Rhythm Nation 1814
As I was walkin' by
Saw you standin' there with a smile
Lookin' shy, you caught my eye
Thought you'd want to hang for a while
Well I'd like to be with you
And you know it's Friday too
I hope you can find the time
This weekend to relax and unwind
My mind's tired
I've worked so hard all week
Cashed my check
I'm ready to go
I promise you
I'll show you such a good time
Come on baby, let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me, we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade (let's go)
Escapade
We'll have a good time
Escapade
Leave your worries behind
Escapade
Well you could be mine
Escapade
An escapade
So don't hold back
Just have a good time, yeah yeah
We'll make the rules up as we go along
And break them all if we're not havin' fun
Come on baby let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade
Come on baby let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade (let's go)
Escapade
We'll have a good time
Escapade
Leave your worries behind
Escapade
Well you could be mine
Escapade
An escapade
(My mind's tired I've worked
Worked so hard all week
I just got paid, we've got it made
Ready to go
I promise you I'll show you
Such a good time)
Come on baby let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade
Come on baby let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade (let's go)
Come on baby let's get away
Let's save our troubles for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on an escapade
