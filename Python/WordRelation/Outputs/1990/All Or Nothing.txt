79. Milli VanilliGirl You Know It&#039;s True
All or nothing... push
All or nothing... Girl let it be
Night after night it starts the same
Talking with my baby on lovers lane
You're real sweet and all a glow
Turn me on and then you're ready to go
I ask her, baby can I walk you home
She says okay I hate to be alone
I'm dreaming, you're smiling
You're my girl
My fantasy in this world
Nothing is wrong with being in love
It's a wonderful feeling from heaven above
Squeeze me
Please me
Turn me on
I love you so much
You can never go wrong
I like your smile
I like your touch
All or nothing
'Cos I want you so much
I'm longing for your tender kiss
Baby I wanna tell you this :
All or nothing... push
It's got to be
Something's gotta show
When you're living under heat
All or nothing... push
Girl let it be
Take it from a pro
Who's rocking to the beat
I'm under heat oh baby
Please take it slow
Give me some time and maybe
Our love will grow
I wanna suit you baby
And make it right
Take it from me babe
I wanna rock all night
If it's good for me
It's good for you, you gotta
Never let your mood get dry
Just keep it wet and my 740 jet
Is pushing right on high
You're the girl of my dream
You're making me hot
You're looking good
You're too ot to trot
I wanna be with you through all the hours and shower you with all my
flowers
I like your smile
I like your touch
All or nothing
'Cos I want you so much
I'm longing for your tender kiss
Baby I wanna tell you this :
All or nothing... push
It's got to be
Something's gotta show
When you're living under heat
All or nothing... push
Girl let it be
Take it from a pro
Who's rocking to the beat
I'm under heat oh baby
Please take it slow
Give me some time and maybe
Our love will grow
I wanna suit you baby
And make it right
Take it from me babe
I wanna rock all night
All or nothing... push
It's got to be
Something's gotta show
When you're living under heat
All or nothing... push
Girl let it be
Take it from a pro
Who's rocking to the beat
