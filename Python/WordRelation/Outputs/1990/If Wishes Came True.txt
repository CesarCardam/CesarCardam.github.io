25. Sweet Sensation album
All alone silence fills my room
But in a memory, I hear you calling me
Close my eyes and I'm there with you
Like it was yesterday, but then it fades away
Take me back, turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way agan
If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes cam true
Then I would be that someone always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers, not apart
If wishes came true
Now you're gone and I'm on my own
Feeling lost inside since you said good-bye
In my dreams I still feel your touch
Lying next to me, feeling ecstacy
Take me back, turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again
If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers, not apart
If wishes came true
I love you madly
I need you badly
Give our love one more chance
Take me back, turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain
Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again
If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers, not apart
If wishes came true
