91. Aerosmith A Little South Of Sanity (Live)
There goes my old girlfriend, there's another diamond ring.
And, uh, all those late night promises, I guess they don't mean a thing.
So baby, what's the story?
Did you find another man?
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made?
When you don't look back I guess the feelings start to fade away.
I used to feel your fire but now it's cold inside.
And you're back on the street like you didn't miss a beat, yeah.
Tell me what it takes to let you go.
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go.
Tell me how it is that you can sleep
In the night
Without thinking you lost ev'rything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice?
Tell me what it takes to let you go. Yeah.
Girl, before I met you I was F.I.N.E. Fine.
But your love made me a prisoner, yeah my heart's been doing time.
You spent me up like money then you hung me out to dry.
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise.
'Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes.
Tell me what it takes to let you go.
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go.
Tell me how it is that you can sleep
In the night
Without thinking you lost ev'rything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice?
Tell me what it takes to let you go.
Guitar!
Tell me that you're happy, that you're on your own.
Yeah yeah, yeah
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone.
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch.
Tell me that my lovin' didn't mean that much.
Tell me you ain't dyin' when you're cryin' for me.
Tell me what it takes to let you go.
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go.
Uh, tell me how it is that you can sleep
In the night
Without thinkin' you lost ev'rything that was good in your life to the toss of the dice?
Tell me who's to blame for thinkin' twice.
No no no no.
'Cause I don't wanna burn in paradise.
Let go. Let go. Let go. I don't wanna burn in paradise.
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go,
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go,
I don't wanna burn, I don't wanna burn
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go,
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go,
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go,
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go,
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go,
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go,
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go,
