11. Bell Biv Devoe Poison
Take a look at me
Tell me, do you like what you see?
Do you think you can
Do you think you can do me?
Kiss me, pretty baby
Touch me all over
Girl, what makes you think you can do me
Do you think you can do me, girl?
Do me, baby (ho, ooh)
Do me, baby (do you think you can?)
Do me, baby (do me)
Do me, baby
Girl, let your hair down
Take off your clothes and leave on your shoes
Would you mind if I looked at you for a moment?
Before I make sweet love
Backstage, underage, adolescent
How ya doin', fine, she replied
I sighed, I like to do the wild thing
Action took place
Kinda wet, don't forget
The J, the I, the M, the M, the Y, why'all
I need a body bag
Do me, baby (oh, oh, oh)
Do me, baby (you can do me when you want to do me)
Do me, baby (yeah, yeah)
Do me, baby (mmm, ho, ho, ooh, yeah)
Do me, baby (I like it in the morning time, yeah)
Do me, baby (sometimes I love it in the evening, baby, yeah)
Do me, baby (can you do me all over, girl, yeah, yeah)
Do me, baby
The time was six o'clock on the Swatch watch
No time to chill, got a date, can't be late
Hey, the girl is gonna do me
Move to the Jacuzzi, ooh, that booty
Smack it up, flip it, rub it down, oh, no
Do me, baby (yeah)
Do me, baby (oh, baby, I like it just like that)
Do me, baby (and I love the way you do it to me, baby, yeah)
Do me, baby (oh, move just a little bit closer)
You can do me in the morning
You can do me in the night
You can do me when you want to do me
You can do me in the morning
You can do me in the night
You can do me when you want to do me
Oh, come on and sweat me
Will you just take a little bit, yeah?
That's the way I like it, baby
Come on over here
Let me caress your beautiful body
Kiss you from head to toe
I'll make you sweat, yeah
We're gonna train up in here all the way
Nine to five, baby
You just sweat, baby
That's the way I like to do it
Run you all over with some hot oil
And just watch your body shine
I just want to
I just want to lay your beautiful body down by the fireplace, baby
And make love to you all, all night
Oh, yeah
I love you, baby, yeah
Oh, ho
Oh, yeah
