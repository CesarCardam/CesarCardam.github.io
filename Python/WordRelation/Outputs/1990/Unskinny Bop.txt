32. Poison Poison&#039;s Greatest Hits: 1986-1996
What's got you so jumpy?
Why can't you sit still, yeah?
Like gasoline you want to pump me
And leave me when you get your fill, yeah
Every time I touch you honey you get hot
I want to make love you never stop
Come up for air you push me to the floor
What's been going on in that head of yours
Unskinny bop
Just blows me away
Unskinny bop, bop
All night and day
Unskinny bop, bop, bop, bop
She just loves to play
Unskinny bop nothin' more to say
You look at me so funny
Love bite got you acting oh so strange
You got too many bees in your honey
Am I just another word in your page, yeah, yeah
Every time I touch you you get hot
I want to make love you never stop
Come up for air you push me to the floor
What's been going on in that head of yours
Unskinny bop
Just blows me away
Unskinny bop, bop
All night and day
Unskinny bop, bop, bop, bop
She just loves to play
Unskinny bop nothin' more to say
You're sayin' my love won't do ya
That ain't love written on your face
Well honey I can see right through ya
Yeah whose ridin' who at the end of the race
What's right
What's wrong
What's left
What the hell is going on
Unskinny bop
Just blows me away
Unskinny bop, bop
All night and day
Unskinny bop, bop, bop, bop
She just loves to play
(Up for air, pulled to the floor)
Unskinny bop
No good, no good
Unskinny bop, bop
All night n' day, do it
Unskinny bop, bop, bop, bop
No good, no good, good, no good
Unskinny bop (oh ooh)
Unskinny bop
