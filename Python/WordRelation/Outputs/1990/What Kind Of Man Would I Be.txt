71. Chicago Chicago Box (Bonus DVD)
Girl, well, it's been one of those days again
And it seems like the harder I try
Over and over, I'm right back where I began
But you understand
Oh, girl, when nothing else in this world goes right
Oh, I just want to run to you
You pull me through
Oh, baby, who wouldn't want to have you in their lives?
Tell me, what kind of man would I be?
Living a life without any meaning
And I know you could surely survive without me
But if I have to live without you
Tell me, what kind of man would I be?
Times when it was pointless for me to try
I was more than a desperate man
What seemed like forever
Was gone with one touch of your hand
Oh, girl, if I could count all the sleepless nights
When you were there for me
A fool could see
Woh, baby, Once I had found you there was no letting go
Tell me, what kind of man would I be?
Living a life without any meaning
And I know you could surely survive without me
But if I have to live without you
Tell me, what kind of man would I be?
Tell me, what kind of man would I be?
Living a life without any meaning
And I know you could surely survive without me
But if I have to live without you
Tell me, what kind of man would I be?
What kind of man would I be?
Living a life without any meaning
And I know you could surely survive without me
But if I have to live without you
Tell me, what kind of man
Tell me, what kind of man
Tell me, what kind of man would I be?
(What kind of man would I be?)
Tell me, what kind of man would I be?
(What kind of man would I be?)
