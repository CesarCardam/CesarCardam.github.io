Imagine..... Whoa, woa.
Woa, woa.
Big bill collecters, the ring my phone,
they bother me when I'm not at home.
Ain't got no time to be fooling 'found,
feet hit the floor then I get on down.
You see I want money,
lot's and lot's of money.
I want the pie in the sky,
I want lot's and lot's of money,
so don't be asking my why.
I wanna be rich, oh,
I wanna be rich, oh,
I wanna be rich, oh,
I wanna be rich ,
for a little love, peace and happiness.
I want my cake, wanna eat it too,
I want the stars, the silver moon.
I spend my money on lottery,
my fav'rite number is one, two, three.
You see I want money,
lot's and lot's of money.
I want the pie in the sky,
I want lot's and lot's of money,
so don't be asking my why.
I wanna be rich, oh,
I wanna be rich, oh,
I wanna be rich, oh,
I wanna be rich ,
for a little love, peace and happiness.
Everywhere rich.
Love, peace and happiness.
I want all the things that lovers do,
a pocketful of dreams come true.
Even things you can not find,
won't you find the time to keep you satisfied.
I'm rich!
rich
You see I want money,
lot's and lot's of money.
I want the pie in the sky,
I want lot's and lot's of money,
so don't be asking my why.
I wanna be rich, oh,
I wanna be rich, oh,
I wanna be rich, oh,
I wanna be rich ,
for a little love, peace and happiness.
