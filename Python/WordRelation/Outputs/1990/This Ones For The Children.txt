90. New Kids On The Block New Kids On The Block - Greatest Hits
There are some people living in this world:
They have no food to eat, they have no place to go.
But we all are God's children, we have to learn to love one another.
Just remember they could be us.
Remember we all are brothers.
I'm not trying to darken up your day.
But help others in need and show them there's a better way.
This one's for the children, the children of the world.
This one's for the children.
May God keep them in His throne.
Many people are happy and many people are sad.
Some people have many things that others can only wish they had.
So, for the sake of the children, show them love's the only way to go
'Cause they're our tomorrow, and people they've got to know.
I'm not trying to darken up your day.
But help others in need and show them there's a better way.
This one's for the children, the children of the world.
This one's for the children.
May God keep them in His throne.
