What you've been missin' in a man
I can supply it your wish is my command
I'll work hard to fill your needs
Give you a lesson on what it is to feel
Feel good baby
Get undressed and slip on this robe
Feel good relax
Just sit back prepare to be stroked
Do you feel the magic in my hands when I touch
And rub you the right way
Strokes applied with tenderness when I hold
And rub you the right way
A light massage a soft caress
Whenever I do a rub I rub for happiness
Customer satisfaction is a guarantee
Sent for your pleasure I'm only here to please
Please you baby
So hold on and don't let go
Show you
I'll show you pleasure like you've never known
Do you feel the magic in my hands when I touch
And rub you the right way
Strokes applied with tenderness when I hold
And rub you the right way
