93. The Time Pandemonium
I got real bored on a Friday night, I couldn't find a damn thing to do.
So I pulled out a suit about the same color as my BMW.
I drove to the party and I pimped on in, just to see what I could see.
Everybody knew what I was lookin' for, I was lookin' for some company.
I saw a real fine thing sittin' by the bar. She looked kinda all alone.
So I pimped on over and I asked her name. The child was bad to the bone.
I showed her my stash and I kissed her cheek. The only kind of rap it takes.
She knew I was bad when I pulled out a leash, she said "How much money you make?"
Jerk it, jerk it. Talkin' 'bout the jerk out.
Jerk it, jerk it. Talkin' 'bout the jerk out.
I took her to my crib and I tied her up. I figured that's what she liked.
Maybe I was wrong but what the hell, it didn't matter to me. She was white.
I said "How come people in your neighborhood, don't like it when a brother's rich?
Ain't my blood the same color as yours? Answer that question, bitch!"
It just pisses you off to see me drivin' that fancy car, don't it?
Bet you'd rather see me drivin' one of those ester grate ones.
Like the one your daddy drives, wouldn't you?
Let me tell you one thing. That's dead!
About as dead as you'll be if you don't rearrange your brain.
Catch my drift. Turn it up!
Oh, nasty me!
Girl, you think you want to turn it up? Where's my checkbook?
That's right, check it out. An awful lot of O's, wouldn't you say?
Hit it. Cross over, uh!
Turn it up.
Jerk out, jerkin' everything in sight.
Jerk out, got to make some love tonight.
Jerk out.
Don't ya all just hate it, when we walk into y'all's joint?
And just jerk out everything in sight?
Don't it make you mad?
Jerk out, don't it make you mad?
Jerk out, it'd make me mad!
Everybody in the house say "Jerk out", Jerk out!
"Ow!", Ow!
Say "Jerk out", Jerk out!
"Ow!", Ow!
Everybody say "Jerk out", Jerk out!
"Ow!", Ow!
Everybody say "Jerk out", Jerk out!

People, let me turn it up. Which coat should I wear tonight?
If you think I'm vain, you're right.
Look out, somebody say "Vanity", Vanity!
"Jerk out", Jerk out!
"Ow!", Ow!
Everybody jerk out and do it right.
I'm talkin' 'bout the jerk out.
Oh Lord, hey yeah. Got to make some love tonight.
I'm master of the jerk out, oh Lord. Jerkin' everything in sight.
