You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
Oh, oh, oh, it's true
Oh, oh, I love you
You showed me how to say
Exactly what you say
In that very special way
Oh, oh, oh, it's true
You fell for me too
And when I tried it
I could see you fall
And I decided
It's not a trip at all
You taught it to me too
Exactly what you do
And now you love me too
Oh, oh, oh, it's true
We're in love we too
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Oh oh oh oh oh
We're in love we two
We two
You showed me how to do
