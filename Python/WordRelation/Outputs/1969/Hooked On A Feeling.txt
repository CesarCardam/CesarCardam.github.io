99. B.J. Thomasalbum
I can't stop this feelin'
Deep inside of me
Girl you just don't realize
What you do to me
When you hold me
In your arms so tight
You let me know
Everything's alright
I'm...
Hooked on a feelin'
I'm high on believin'
That you're in love with me
Lips are sweet as candy
The taste stays on my mind
Girl, you keep me thirsty
For another cup of wine
I got it bad for you, girl
But I don't need a cure
I'll just stay addicted
And hope I can endure
All the good love
When we're all alone
Keep it up, girl
Yeah you turn me on
I'm...
Hooked on a feelin'
I'm high on believin'
That you're in love with me
All the good love
When we're all alone,
Keep it up, girl,
Yeah you turn me on.
I'm...
Hooked on a feelin'
I'm high on believin'
That you're in love with me
I'm hooked on a feelin'
And I'm high on believin'
That you're in love with me
I said I'm hooked on a feelin'
I'm high on believin'
That you're in love with me
