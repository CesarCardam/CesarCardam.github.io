44. Guess Whoalbum
These eyes, cry every night for you
These arms, long to hold you again
The hurtings on me, yeah
And I will never be free, no, my baby, no no
You gave a promise to me, yeah
And you broke it, and you broke it, oh no
These eyes watched you bring my world to an end
This heart could not accept and pretend
The hurtings on me, yeah
And I will never be free, no, no, no
You took the vow with me, yeah
And you spoke it, and you spoke it, babe
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But they're never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, cry every night for you
These arms, these arms long to hold you, hold you again
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But their never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But their never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But their never gonna see another one like I had with you
These eyes, are crying
These eyes have seen a lot of loves
But their never gonna see another one like I had with you
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't ya know these...
