I don't have to beg you to hold me
Cause somebody else will
You don't have to love me when I want it
Cause somebody else will
Your so called friends say you don't need it
When all the time they're trying to get it
Look out
Your good thing
Is about to come to an end
Your real good thing
Is about to come to an end
All those nights I watched the four walls
I did not have to watch them all alone
When other men said they wanted me
I didn't have to tell them I was your very own
You have all the love that I've got baby
Even ice melts to water and gets hot
Look out
Your good thing
Is about to come to an end
Your real good thing
Is about to end
Gettin' myself back together
Is gonna be a big problem I know
But when the right man says he wants me
You can bet I won't say no
Cause your real good thing
Is about to end
Your real, your good thing
Your good thing, baby
Your good thing
Your good thing
Is about to come to an end
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your good thing
Your good thing
Your good thing, baby
