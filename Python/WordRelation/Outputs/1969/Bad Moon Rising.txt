I see the bad moon arising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see those bad times today
Don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
I hear hurricanes a blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers over flowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin
Well don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise, oh right
Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
Well don't go around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
Don't come around tonight
Well it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
