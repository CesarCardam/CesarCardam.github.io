We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
So, if an old friend I know
Stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see these tears are real, and I'm crying
(Yes I'm crying)
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
Oh, let our love survive
Or dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When honey, you know I've never lied to you
Mmm yeah, yeah
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?
Well don't you know, caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Don't you know I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Don't you know I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Don't you know I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Don't you know I'm caught in a trap?
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Don't you know I'm caught in a trap...
