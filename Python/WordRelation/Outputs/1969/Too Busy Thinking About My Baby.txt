14. Marvin GayeCollected
Listen to me people
I ain't got time to think about Money
Or what it can buy
And I ain't got time to sit down and wonder
What make the birdies fly
And I don't have time to think about
What makes the flowers grow
And I've never given it a second thought
To where the rivers flow
And I ain't got time for nothin' else
I ain't got time to discuss the weather
And how long it's going to last
And I ain't got time to do no studying
Once I get out of class
I'm telling you I'm just a fellow with a one track mind
And when it comes to thinkin' about
Anything but my baby
I just don't have the time
Oh yeah
And I ain't got time for nothin' else
Don't you know I, I'm thinking about my baby
I ain't got time for nothin' else
Yeah the world could ever match her wealth
She's some kinda wonderful
Got heaven right here on earth
'Cause I'm just a fellow with a one track mind
And when it comes to thinkin about
Anything but my baby
I just don't have the time
I'm too busy thinkin' about my baby
Oh I ain't got time for nothin' else
Too busy thinkin' about my baby
Ain't got time for nothing else
