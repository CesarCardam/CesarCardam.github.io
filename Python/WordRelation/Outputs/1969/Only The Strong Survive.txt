38. Jerry ButlerThe Iceman Cometh/Ice on Ice
I remember, my first love affair
Somehow or another the whole darn thing went wrong
My mama had some great advice
So I thought I'd put it into words of this song
I can still hear her saying it
Boy, oh, I see you're sitting out there all alone
Cryin' your eyes out
'Cause the woman that you love has gone
There's gonna be, there's gonna be
A whole lot of trouble in your life
So listen to me get up off of your knees
'Cause only the strong survive
That's what she said
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
You've got to be strong, you'd better hold on
Don't go, all around with your head hung down
I wouldn't let that little girl
No, I wouldn't let her know
That she made me feel like a clown
There's a whole lot a girl
Lookin' for a good man like you
Oh, but you'll never meet them if you give up now
And say, your life is through
Then she said it
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
You've got to be a man, you've got to take a stand
So I am telling you right now
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
You've got to be strong, you'd better hold on
Don't worry about it
Don't you know that things are gonna change
But you've got to be a man, you've got to take a stand
Don't ever feel that like you can make it baby
