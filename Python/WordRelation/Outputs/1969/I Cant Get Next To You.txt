I
Can turn the gray sky blue
I can make it rain, whenever I want it to, oh I
I can build a castle from a single grain of sand
I can make a ship sail, on dry land tell 'em yeah
But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue
'Cause I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you, babe (next to you)
I can't get next to you (I just can't get next you)
I can't get next to you, babe
I can't get next to you
I
Can fly like a bird in the sky
Hey, and I can buy anything that money can't buy
Oh, I
I can turn a river into a raging fire
I can live forever if I so desired
Unimportant are all the things I can do
'Cause I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you, babe (no matter what I do)
I can't get next to you
Uh-ya
Ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo
Chica boom, chica boom
Chica boom, boom, boom
I can turn back the hands of time, you better believe I can
I can make the seasons change, just by waving my hand
Oh, I
I can change anything from old to new
The things I want to do the most, I'm unable to do
Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess
'Cause girl you're the key to my happiness
And I
Can't get next to you
Girl, you're blowing my mind 'cause I can't get (next to you)
Can't you see these tears I'm crying? I can't get (next to you)
Girl, it's you that I need, I gotta get (next to you)
Can't you see these tears I'm crying? I can't get (next to you)
I, I, I, I, I can't get (next to you)
I, I, I, I, I can't get (next to you)
Girl, you're blowing my mind
