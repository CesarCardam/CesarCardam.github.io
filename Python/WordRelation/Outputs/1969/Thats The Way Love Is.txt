72. Marvin GayeCollected
Ah, baby, as the bitter tears fall from your eyes
Oh, a thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you love has departed
Oh, you're left alone and broken-hearted, ooh
Love just comes and it goes
How long it's gonna last, say, nobody knows
That's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sure enough, how it is)
Oh, that's the way love is, sugar, that's how it is
(That's the way love is, sure enough how it is)
Oh, that's how it is, my little dalin'
I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road
And your heart is carryin' a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend (ain't got a friend)
Oh, and your whole world is cavin' in (whole world cavin' in)
Oh, but now's the time to be strong (to be strong)
You gotta forget him now that he's gone (now that he's gone)
And remember
That's the way love is, honey
(That's the way love is, sure enough how it is)
That's the way love is, baby, that's how it is
(That's the way love is, sure enough how it is)
Oh, oh, my little darlin'
Oh, baby, ooh
Oh, listen to me, little darlin'
The road of love gets rough sometimes don't let it get the best of you
Said, I've been hurt by another so many times
So I know just what you're goin' through
Oh, you wish that you were never born, you gotta forget him now that he's gone
Just remember
That's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sure enough how it is)
Oh, that's the way love is, honey
(That's the way love is, sure enough how it is)
That's how it is
So wipe away your tears
Love is here today and gone tomorrow
(That's the way love is, sure enough how it is)
I-I say all of your joys turn to sorrow
(That's the way love is, sure enough how it is)
Oh, one day gladness, next day sadness
