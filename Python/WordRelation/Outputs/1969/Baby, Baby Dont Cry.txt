Nothing so blue as a heart in pain
Nothing so sad as a tear in vain
Let him walk on out if he wants to
He really doesn't deserve you
His loss is our gain so don't be blue
Cause stone blind and out of his mind
Is what he has to be, yeah
So baby straighten up, come on and fly right
It's no catastrophe, yeah
And say now baby, baby don't cry
Baby, baby don't cry
Baby, baby here's why
Love is here standing by
Love is here standing by
Too bad it was him that you trusted
Too bad but you can't be disgusted
It's time that you got readjusted
And realized that tear filled eyes
Can't stop him now
That man is on his way
I think he's gone to stay
You better drop him now, yeah
Oowee now, baby, baby don't cry
Baby, baby don't cry
Baby, baby here's why
Because love is here standing by
Love is here standing by
You trusted him and gave him your love
A love he proved unworthy of
Oh baby, oh baby all you've got to do
Is dry your eyes long enough to see
That you have found the love you thought
You had in him here in me
Love is hope girl, love is strength
Here's someone standing right beside you
Who would go to any length
To give you love true and deep
And hope you realize at last
You found a love that you can keep
And only losers weep
So standing by you , tears aren't shed in vain
I said so
