97. David Ruffinalbum
Last week my life had meaning, it was beautiful and so sweet.
But now it's nothing, nothing without you, baby,
My whole world is incomplete.
'Cause honey, I can't see you no more.
That was all that you said, baby,
But you just might as well placed a gun to my head, baby, baby.
(Oh! How could you do it!)
My Whole World Ended the moment you left me, Yeah, baby.
Honey, My Whole World Ended the moment you left me.
It tumbled down to the ground, baby.
Did you ever mean those sweet things,
Ah, that you used to say?
(Spoken): Did you mean it baby?
Of a house with a lovely, lovely garden,
And a little baby some day.
Ah! Tell me, where did I go wrong, honey?
Whatever changed your mind, baby?
I've asked myself these questions over a million times, baby, baby.
(Oh! How could you do it!)
My Whole World Ended the moment you left me, Yeah, baby.
Honey, My Whole World Ended the moment you left me.
It tumbled down to the ground, baby, baby, baby.
Now my body is numb, I feel so senseless to the touch,
My life is so wasted without you,
I guess I loved you much too much.
How can I face tomorrow,
When yesterday is all I see?
I just don't wanna face tomorrow, if you're not sharing it with me.
Baby, baby,
(Tell me why.)
My Whole World Ended the moment you left me, Yeah, baby.
Honey, My Whole World Ended the moment you left me.
It tumbled down to the ground, baby, baby, baby.
