I'll try every trick in the book
With every step that you take, everywhere that you look
Just look and you'll find
I'll try to get to your soul, I'll try to get to your mind
I'm gonna make you mine
I know I'll never give up, I'm at the end of my rope
From the morning till suppertime, you'll find
I'll be waiting in line, I'll be waiting in line
I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
Make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
I'll try every trick in the book
With every step that you take, everywhere that you look
Just look and you'll find
I'll be waiting in line, I'll be waiting in line
I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
Make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
I'll be a hard-lovin', pushin' kind of individual
Knockin' night and day at your door
You'll have to turn me away like an indestructible force
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
Make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
I'll try every trick in the book
With every step that you take, everywhere that you look
Just look and you'll find
I'll try to get to your soul, I'll try to get to your mind
I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
Make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
Make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
