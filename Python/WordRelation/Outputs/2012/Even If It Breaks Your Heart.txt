99. Eli Young Bandalbum
Way back on the radio dial,
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul,
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll
Oh, I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol guitar
Oh, I can hear em singin',
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"
Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk,
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night
Oh, I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear em singin,
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"
Some dreams stay with you forever,
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better,
Gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure
Oh, I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear em singin',
"Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart"
Oh, I can hear em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear em singin',
"Keep on dreamin, even if it breaks your heart"
Keep on dreamin, even if it breaks your heart
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, keep on dreamin', oh oh oh
oh oh oh, don't let it break your heart
