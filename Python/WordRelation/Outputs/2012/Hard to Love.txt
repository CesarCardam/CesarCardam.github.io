95. Lee BriceHard 2 Love
I am insensitive, I have a tendency
To pay more attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink to much, sometimes I test your trust,
Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me
I'm hard to love, hard to love,
Oh I don't make it easy,
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love,
You say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning full of grace and full of Jesus
And I wish that I could be more like you
I'm hard to love, hard to love,
Oh I don't make it easy,
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood,
I'm hard to love, hard to love,
You say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
Love me good
Girl you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted,
I'm just a man,
I'm just a man
Hard to love, hard to love,
Oh I don't make it easy,
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love
And you say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Hard to love, hard to love,
Oh I don't make it easy,
And I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love
And you say that you need me,
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
You love me good
You love me good
