53. Luke BryanTailgates &amp; Tanlines
Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, four wheel drive
And a tail light circle
Roll down the windows turn it on up
Pour a little Crown in a Dixie cup
Get the party, started
Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in the full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
If you ain't a ten you're a nine point nine
Tippin' n' spillin' that home made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Thrown little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God all mighty
Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm mmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
So let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water
Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be,
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
Yeah I'm a little drunk on you
