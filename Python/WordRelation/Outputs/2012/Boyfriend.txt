VERSE 1
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
I can take you places you ain't never been before
Baby take a chance or you'll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I'd really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin by the fire while we eatin' fondue
I dunno about me but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three two swag
PRE HOOK
I'd like to be everything you want
Hey girl, let me talk to you
HOOK
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go
Keep you on my arm girl, you'd never be alone
I can be a gentleman, anything you want
If I was your boyfriend, I'd never let you go, I'd never let you go
VERSE 2
Tell me what you like yeah tell me what you don't
I could be your Buzz Lightyear fly across the globe
I don't ever wanna fight yeah, you already know
Imma make you shine bright like you're laying in the snow, burr
Girlfriend, girlfriend, you could be my girlfriend
You could be my girlfriend until the epic world ends
Make you dance do a spin and a twirl
Voice goin crazy on this hook like a whirl wind
