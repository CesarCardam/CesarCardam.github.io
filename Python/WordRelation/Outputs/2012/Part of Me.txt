31. Katy PerryTeenage Dream: The Complete Confection
Days like this,
I want to drive away
Pack my bags
And watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up
And spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light
You drained me down
But that was then
And this is now
Now look at me!
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and stones,
Throw your bombs and bones,
But you're not gonna break my soul.
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off,
Your love was cheap
It was always tearing at the seams,
I fell deep, you let me down,
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me!
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and stones,
Throw your bombs and bones,
But you're not gonna break my soul.
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no!
Now look at me I'm sparkling,
A firework, a dancing' flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowing', oh woah,
So you can keep the diamond ring,
It don't mean nothing anyway,
In fact you can keep everything, yeah, yeah, yeah
Except for me!
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and stones,
Throw your bombs and bones,
But you're not gonna break my
Soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and stones,
Throw your bombs and bones,
But you're not gonna break my
Soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
no, no
