Im ridin round with that nina
You know we smokin on Keisha
Hey, hey, hey can I meet you hoe?
(Cool)
[Chorus]
36 Os so Im ridin round with that nina (Im ridin round with that nina)
Ridin with a hoe named Keisha, smokin on Keisha (You know we smokin on Keisha)
My diamonds talk for me, they say "Hi can I meet you hoe?" (Hey can I meet you hoe?)
She fly high, high in the sky, hoe I cant see you (Well I cant see you)
Got a condo on my wrist - girl, Im cashin out (Im cashin out)
Got a condo around my neck - girl, Im cashin out (Im cashin out)

My diamonds talk for me, they say "Hi can I meet you?"
[Verse 1]

Plus these plugs all on my back, cause they know Im movin that pack
These Louies all in my face, fo-fifth stay up on my waist
Plus it aint on me for nothin, so please dont make me catch a case
Cause bitch Im bout it, me walkin round with no check on me

And if I got it I bought it, cause boy you know Im cashin out (cool)
[Chorus]

Ridin with a hoe named Keisha, smokin on Keisha (You know we smokin on Keisha)

[Verse 2]
Okay I drop the top, hop in

Birds comin by flocks in

Got Spinz on the beat so we aint losing

Pussy so good you should thank moms, top flo suite chillin at The Palms
We want the whole loaf leave yall the crumbs, til then Im runnin my check up
And its fuck a Bugatti; Im callin my jet up (cool)
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah - its big pimpin over here - touch
Time to cop the Maybach already had the vert
I got big money visions, Sammy Sosa pigeons
What that mean? That mean they jumpin out the kitchen
And Im on the money mission, nobody can stop me
Just grab your camcorder, press record and go on and watch me
And you can skate on my ice, just like you playin hockey
And in the booth, I beat the beat up
Call me Rocky, yeah Im cocky (cool)
[Chorus]
36 Os so Im ridin round with that nina (Im ridin round with that nina)
Ridin with a hoe named Keisha, smokin on Keisha (You know we smokin on Keisha)
My diamonds talk for me, they say "Hi can I meet you hoe?" (Hey can I meet you hoe?)
She fly high, high in the sky, hoe I cant see you (Well I cant see you)
Got a condo on my wrist - girl, Im cashin out (Im cashin out)
Got a condo around my neck - girl, Im cashin out (Im cashin out)
36 Os so Im ridin round with that nina
My diamonds talk for me, they say "Hi can I meet you?"
[Outro]
Im ridin round with that nina
You know we smokin on Keisha
Hey, hey, hey can I meet you hoe?
