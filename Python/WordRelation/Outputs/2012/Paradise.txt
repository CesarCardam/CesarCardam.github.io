69. ColdplayMylo Xyloto
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo.
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo.
When she was just a girl,
She expected the world,
But it flew away from her reach,
So she ran away in her sleep.
And dreamed of para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
Every time she closed her eyes.
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo.
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo.
When she was just a girl,
She expected the world,
But it flew away from her reach,
And bullets catching her teeth.
Life goes on,
It gets so heavy,
The wheel breaks the butterfly.
Every tear, a waterfall.
In the night, the stormy night,
She closed her eyes.
In the night, the stormy night,
Away she flied.
And dream of para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.
She dreamed of para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.
La-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la.
So lying underneath the stormy skies.
She said oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.
I know the sun's set to rise.
This could be para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
Could be para-para-paradise,
Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.
This could be para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
Could be para-para-paradise,
Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.
(Oh, oh. Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo.)
This could be para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
Para-para-paradise,
Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh.
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-ooo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-ooo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-ooo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-ooo...
