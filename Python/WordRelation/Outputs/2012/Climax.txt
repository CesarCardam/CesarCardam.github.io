72. UsherLooking 4 Myself (Deluxe Version)
Going no where fast
We've reached the climax
Were together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to
Run away, do we separate
Oh Don't wanna give in
So we both gave up
Can't take it back
It's too late we've reached our climax, climax
I've fallin' somehow, feet off the ground
Love is the cloud , that keeps raining down
Where are you now? When I need you around
I'm on my knees but it seems we're
Going no where fast
We've reached the climax
Were together, now we're undone
Wont commit so we choose to
Run away, do we separate
Oh Don't wanna give in
So we both gave up
Can't take it back
It's too late we've reached our climax, climax
I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You came and said we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all, at all, at all, at all
Going no where fast
We've reached the climax
Were together, now we're undone
Wont commit so we choose to
Run away, do we separate
Oh Don't wanna give in
So we both gave up
Can't take it back
It's too late we've reached our climax, climax
But you say it's better if we,
love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had off my mind
Where are you now? When I need you around
I'm on my knees but it seems we're
Going no where fast
We've reached the climax
Were together, now we're undone
Wont commit so we choose to
Run away, do we separate
Oh Don't wanna give in
So we both gave up
Can't take it back
It's too late we've reached our climax, climax
