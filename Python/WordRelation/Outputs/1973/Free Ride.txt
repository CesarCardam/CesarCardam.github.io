Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
The mountain is high the valley is low
And you're confused on which way to go
So I've come here to give you a hand
And lead you into the promised land
So, come on and take a free ride
(Free ride)
Come on and sit by my side
Come on and take a free ride
All over the country I've seen it the same
Nobody's winning at this kind of game
We've gotta do better, it's time to begin
You know all the answers must come from within
So come on and take a free ride
(Free ride)
Come on and sit here by my side
Come on and take a free ride
Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
Ah ah come on and take a free ride
Come on and take a free ride yeh yeh yeh yeh
(Come on and take a free ride yeh yeh yeh yeh)
Come on and take a free ride yeh yeh yeh yeh
(Come on and take a free ride yeh yeh yeh yeh)
Come on and take a free ride yeh yeh yeh yeh
(Come on and take a free ride yeh yeh yeh yeh)
The mountain is high, the valley is low
And you're confused on which way to go so
Come on and take a free ride free ride!
