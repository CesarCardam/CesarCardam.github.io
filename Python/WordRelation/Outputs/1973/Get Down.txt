66. Gilbert O'Sullivanalbum
Told you once before
And I won't tell you no more
Get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog baby
But I still want you 'round
You give me the creeps
When you jump on your feet
So get down, get down, get down
Keep your hands to yourself
I'm strictly out of bounds
Once upon a time I drank a little wine
Was as happy as could be, happy as could be
Now I'm just like a cat on a hot tin roof
Baby what do you think you're doin' to me
Told you once before
And I won't tell you no more
So get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog baby
But I still want you 'round, around
I still want you around
