98. Albert HammondIt Never Rains in Southern California
Get on board a west bound 747
Didn't think before deciding what to do
Oh, they talked about their duties
TV breaks the movies
I'm true, sure I'm true
Seems it never rains in southern California
Seems I often heard this kind of talk before
It never rains in California
But girls don't they warn ya
It pours, man it pours
I'm out of work, I'm out of my head
Out of self respect, I'm out of bread
I'm underloved, I'm underfed, I wanna go home
It never rains in California
But girls don't they warn ya
It pours, man it pours
Will you tell the folks back home, I nearly made it
That I often don't know which job to take
Please don't tell them how you found me
Don't tell them how you found me
Give me your pray, give me your pray
