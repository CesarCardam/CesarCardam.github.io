94. Waralbum
Walkin' down the street, smoggy-eyed
Looking at the sky, starry-eyed
Searchin' for a place, weary-eyed
Crying in the night, teary-eyed
Don't you know that it's true
That for me and for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know that it's true
That for me and for you
The world is a ghetto
Wonder when I'll find paradise
Somewhere there's a home, sweet and nice
Wonder if I'll find happiness
Never give it up now I guess
Don't you know that it's true
That for me and for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know that it's true
That for me and for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know that it's true
That for me and for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know that it's true
That for me and for you
The world is a ghetto
The world is a ghetto
The world is a ghetto
