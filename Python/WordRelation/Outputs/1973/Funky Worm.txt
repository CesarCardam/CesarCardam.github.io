84. Ohio Playersalbum
You're a little late
So step right this way
And we'll get started
Granny, what? Say it now
Oh, say it now, say it now, ahem
Me and the Ohio Players
Are gonna tell you about a worm
He's the funkiest worm in the world
Alright, sing it, Clarence
Clarence, theres' a worm in the ground
Yes, there is, Granny, that's right
Clarence he's six feet long
Granny, six feet long
Clarence he only comes around
Granny when he wants to get down
But when he comes out of his hole
He sounds something like this
Granny oh, that's funky
Like nine cans of shaving powder, that's funky
Alright, sing it again, Clarence
Clarence and through all the land, yeah
Granny, yeah
Clarence he plays in a band
Granny, plays in a band
Clarence plays guitar without any hands
Pretty good, I might add
Granny, yeah
When he grabs his guitar and starts to pluck
Everybody wants to get up and dance
Granny ah, get it baby
Don't, don't, don't
Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight it
Hey, don't stop now honey, get down
I'm his manager, heh, heh
Gonna make a million dollars
I get it all, 'cause he can't spend it
There he goes, goin' back in his hole
Just the same way he came out
Do we get paid for this
I just wanted to make sure, we do, okay
