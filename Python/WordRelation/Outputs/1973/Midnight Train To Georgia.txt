49. Gladys Knight & The Pipsalbum
L.A. Proved too much for the man
Too much for the man, he couldn't make it
So he's leavin' the life he's come to know uhoo
He said he's goin'
He said he's goin' back to find
Goin' back to find
Ooh, what's left of his world
The world he left behind
Not so long ago
He's leavin' (leavin')
On that midnight train to Georgia
Leavin' on the midnight train
Said he's goin' back
Goin' back to find
To a simpler place in time
Oh yes he is
And I'll be with him (I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia (leavin' on the midnight train to Georgia)
I'd rather live in his world
Than live without him in mine
That world is his, his and 'ers alone
He kept dreamin' (dreamin')
That someday he'd be a star
A super star, but he didn't get far
But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams don't always come true
So he pawned all his hopes
And he even sold his old car
Bought a one way ticket back
To the life he once knew
Oh yes he did
He said he would
Oh oh he's leavin'
On that midnight train to Georgia (leavin' on the midnight train)
Said he's goin' back to find
Oh a simpler place in time
And I'm gonna be with him (I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
I'd rather live in his world
Than be without him in mine
The world is his, his and 'ers alone
Oh he's leavin'
On that midnight train to Georgia (leavin' on the midnight train)
Said he's goin' back to find (goin' back to find)
Oh a simpler place in time
And I've gotta be with him (I know you will)
On the midnight train to Georgia
I'd rather live in his world
Than be without him in mine
The world is his, his and 'ers alone
For love gonna board
The midnight train to Georgia
For love gonna board
The midnight train to Georgia
For love gonna board
The midnight train to Georgia
For love gonna board
The midnight train to Georgia
For love gonna board
The midnight train to Georgia
For love gonna board
The midnight train to Georgia
For love gonna board
The midnight train to Georgia
For love gonna board
The midnight train to Georgia
For love gonna board
The midnight train to Georgia
