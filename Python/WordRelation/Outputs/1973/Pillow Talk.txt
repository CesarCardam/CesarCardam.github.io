Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye
Hey, baby, let me stay
I don't care what your friends are about to say, ah-ah
What you friends all say is fine
But it can't compete with this pillow talk of mine
Ooooh You can't find love on a one way street
It takes two to tango, takes two to even compete, oh, yeah
So boy, just put that stop sign down
And let's get together before the day runs us down
I'm pleading to you now
Hey, baby, let me try
To be the one's who's gonna light your fire, ha-ha
What you friends all say is fine
But it can't compete with this pillow talk of mine
Ooooh, I don't wanna see you be no fool
What I'm teachin' you tonight
Boy, you'll never learn it in school, oh, no
So friends who tell me wrong from right
I'll ask to borrow their man some cold and lonely night
Ooooh, hey, baby, let me be
The one who turns you on from A to Z, ha-ha
What you friends all say is fine
But it can't compete with this pillow talk of mine
Ooooh .. baby
Ooooh, baby, aye
a-la-la-la-la-la-la
Ah ...would you baby
Would you baby,
la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye
Uno momento poquito
Uno momento poquito
Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye
Lie Steady, Lie Steady, Lie Steady
Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye
Oh, my God
