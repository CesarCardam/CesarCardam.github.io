39. Bloodstonealbum
Why do I keep my mind on you all the time
And I don't even know you
Why do I feel this way
Thinking about you every day
And I don't even know you
Take me in your arms
Thrill me with all of your charms
And I'll take to the sky on a natural high
(I want to take to the sky)
Loving you more 'till the day I die
(On the natural high)
Take to the sky on a natural high
(I want you to be mine)
Loving you more.
If you have anything to do
Call me and I will do it for you
And I don't even know you
If I only had one wish to give
That wish would be for you to live forever and ever.
When I see you on the street
My heart skips a beat
And I'll take to the sky on a natural high
(I'll just take to the sky)
Loving you more till the day I die
(on a natural high)
Take to the sky on a natural high
(Loving you more and I don't know you)
Loving you more
I'm gonna try to do
All the things you want me to
If you'll just give me a chance
I'm trying to make something out of a nothing romance
And I don't even know you
Take me in your arms
Thrill me with all of your charms
And I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more 'till the day I die
(To the sky)
I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more
And I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more 'till the day I die
I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving loving you
I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more 'till the day I die
I'll take to the sky on a natural high
Loving loving you
La la la la la la ...
