And when i go away
I know my heart can stay with my love / it's understood
It's in the hands of my love / and my love does it good
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo / my love does it good
And when the cupboards bare
I'll still find something there with my love
It's understood / it's everywhere with my love
And my love does it good
Wo-wo-wo-wo wo-wo-wo-wo
My love does it good
I love oh wo......my love
Only my love holds the other key to me
Oh....my love oh...my love
Only my love does it good to me
Wo-wo-wo-wo wo-wo-wo-wo
My love does it good
Don't ever ask me why / i never say goodbye to my love
It's understood / it's everywhere with my love
And my love does it good
Wo-wo-wo-wo wo-wo-wo-wo
My love does it good
Oh... my love oh...my love
Only my love does it good to me
Wo...
