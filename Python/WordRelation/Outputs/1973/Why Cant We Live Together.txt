75. Timmy ThomasWhy Can&#039;t We Live Together
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why.
Why can't we live together?
Tell me why, tell me why.
Why can't we live together?
Everybody wants to live together.
Why can't we be together?
No more war, no more war, no more war...
Just a little peace.
No more war, no more war.
All we want is some peace in this world.
Everybody wants to live together.
Why can't we be together?
No matter, no matter what colour.
You are still my brother.
I said no matter, no matter what colour.
You are still my brother.
Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we be together?
Everybody wants to live.
Everybody's got to be together.
Everybody wants to live.
Everybody's going to be together.
Everybody's got to be together.
Everybody wants to be together.
I said no matter, no matter what colour.
You're still my brother.
I said no matter, no matter what colour.
You're still my brother.
Everybody wants to live together.
Why can't we be together?
Gotta live together...
Together.
