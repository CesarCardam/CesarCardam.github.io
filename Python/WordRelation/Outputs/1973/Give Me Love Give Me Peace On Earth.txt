42. George HarrisonThe Apple Years
Give me love, give me love, give me
Peace on earth
Give me light, give me life, keep me
Free from birth
Give me hope, help me cope with this
Heavy load
Trying to
Touch and reach you with
Heart and soul....
Oh....
My Lord....
Please....
Take hold of my hand,
That I might understand you
Won't you please,
Oh won't you
