62. Stevie WonderNatural Wonder
People keep on learnin'
Soldiers keep on warrin'
World keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Powers keep on lyin'
While your people keep on dyin'
World keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long
I'm so glad that he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin'
Till I reach my highest ground
Lovers keep on lovin'
Believers keep on believin'
Sleepers just stop sleepin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no
I'm so glad that he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin'
Till I reach my highest ground
Woo!
Till I reach my highest ground
No one's gonna bring me down
Oh no
Till I reach my highest ground
Don't let nobody bring you down (they'll sho 'nough try)
God is gonna show you higher ground
