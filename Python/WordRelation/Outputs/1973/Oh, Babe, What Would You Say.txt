57. Hurricane Smith album
Have I a hope or half a chance
To even ask if I could dance with you, you oo
Would you greet me or politely turn away?
Would there suddenly be sunshine on a cold and rainy day?
Oh, Babe
What would you say?
For there are you sweet lollipop
And here am I with such a lot to say, hey hey
Just to walk with you along the Milky Way
To caress you through the night time
Bring you flowers everyday
Oh Babe
What would you say
'Cause oh, Baby I know
I know I could be so in love with you
And I know that I could make you love me too
And if I could only hear you say you do, oo oo oo oo
But anyway,
What would you say?
Yes oh, Baby I know
I know I could be so in love with you
And I know that I could make you love me too
And if I could only hear you say you do, oo oo oo oo
But anyway,
What would you say?
