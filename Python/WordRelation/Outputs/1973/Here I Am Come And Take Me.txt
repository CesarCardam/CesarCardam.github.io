63. Al GreenLove &amp; Happiness
I can't believe that it's real,
The way that you make me feel.
A burning deep down inside,
A love that I cannot hide.
Our love is you and me baby,
That make the world go round.
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me,
Layin' all my troubles down,
Here I am, baby,
Come and take me.
Here I am, baby,
Come and take me,
Take me by the hand, oh
Show me,
Here I am, baby.
It always ends up this way,
Me begging you every day.
A love that I cannot have,
You broke my heart into half.
Our love is you and me baby, yeah, yeah
That make's the world go round.
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me,
Layin' all my troubles down
Here I am, baby,
Come and take me,
Here I am, baby,
Come and take me,
Take me by the hand, yeah
Squeeze it
Here I am, baby.
When I'm down I can always call you,
For a helpin' hand.
I know you'll do the best you can.
But it don't take much from me,
Just for my cup of Joe.
Oh there's love inside me,
I believe there's going to be an explosion,
It's tough for me, oh baby,
I can do worry,
Tell me all your troubles, yeah
You won't ever have to worry no,
One more thing, you just can't trust everybody,
Everybody you see, oh no, no
You'll find yourselves lost and alone on a dark end of the street,
Here I am, baby,
Come and take me.
Here I am, baby,
Come and take me,
Take me by the hand.
Show me, take me, won't ya
Show me
Here I am, baby
Take me
Teach me, baby
Won't you take me by the hand
Teach me
Here I am baby
