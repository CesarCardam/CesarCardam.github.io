83. Donna Fargoalbum
Funny face, I love you
Funny face, I need you
My whole worlds wrapped up in you
When the road I walk seems all up hill
And the colors in my rainbow turn blue
You kiss the tears away
You smile at me and say
Funny face, funny face I love you
Funny face, I love you
Funny face, I need you
These are the sweetest words I've ever heard
Funny face, don't leave me
Funny face, believe me
My whole world's wrapped up in you.
And when I hurt your feelings as I sometimes do
And I saw those mean things that we know are not true
You forgive my childish ways
You hold me close and say
Funny face, funny face I love you
Funny face, I love you
Funny face, I need you
These are the sweetest words I've ever heard
Funny face, don't leave me
Funny face, believe me
My whole worlds wrapped up in you
Funny face, I love you
Funny face, I need you
These are the sweetest words I've ever heard
Funny face, don't leave me
Funny face, believe me
My whole worlds wrapped up in you
