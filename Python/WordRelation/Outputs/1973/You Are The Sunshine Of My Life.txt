19. Stevie WonderNatural Wonder
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around,
You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart
I feel like this is the beginning,
Though I've loved you for a million years,
And if I thought our love was ending,
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears, whoa oh oh ah
You are the sunshine of my life,
That's why I'll always stay around, mmm mmm yeah yeah
You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart
You must have known that I was lonely,
Because you came to my rescue,
And I know that this must be heaven,
How could so much love be inside of you?
Whoa oh oh oh
You are the sunshine of my life, yeah,
That's why I'll always stay around,
You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart.
You are the sunshine of my life, baby,
That's why I'll always stay around
