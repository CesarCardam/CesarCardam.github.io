I do believe in you
And I know you believe in me
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
And now we realize
Love's not all that it's supposed to be
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
And knowing that you would have wanted it this way
I do believe I'm feelin' stronger every day
I know we really tried
Together we had a love inside
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So now the time has come
For both of us to live on the run
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
And knowing that you would have wanted it this way
I do believe I'm feelin' stronger every day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
After what you've meant to me
Ooh baby now
I can make it easily
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know that we both agree
The best thing to happen to you
Is the best thing that happened to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feelin' stronger every day
Feelin' stronger every day
Feelin' stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
Feelin' stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
Feelin' stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
Feelin' stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
Feelin' stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
Feelin' stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
Feelin' stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
Feelin' stronger every day
(You know I'm alright now)
