23. Grand Funk Railroadalbum
Out on the road for forty days
Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze
Sweet, sweet Connie, doin' her act
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact
Up all night with Freddie King
I got to tell you, poker's his thing
Booze and ladies, keep me right
As long as we can make it to the show tonight
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band
Four young chiquitas in Omaha
Waitin' for the band to return from the show
Feelin' good, feelin' right, it's Saturday night
The hotel detective, he was outta sight
Now these fine ladies, they had a plan
They was out to meet the boys in the band
They said, come on dudes, let's get it on
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're an American band
We're comin' to your town
We'll help you party it down
We're an American band
We're an American band, wooo
We're an American band, wooo
We're an American band, wooo
