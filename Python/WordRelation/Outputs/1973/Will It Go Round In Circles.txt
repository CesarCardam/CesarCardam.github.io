08. Billy Prestonalbum
I got a song that ain't no melody, I'm gonna sing it to my friends
I got a song that ain't no melody, I'm gonna sing it to my friends
Will it go round in circles, will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
Will it go round in circles, will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
I got a story ain't no moral, I let the bad guy win every once in a while
I got a story ain't no moral, I let the bad guy win every once in a while
Will it go round in circles, will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
Will it go round in circles, will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
I got a dance that ain't got no steps, I'm gonna let the music move me around
I got a dance that ain't got no steps, I'm gonna let the music move me around
Will it go round in circles, will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
Will it go round in circles, will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
Will it go round in circles, will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
Will it go round in circles, will it fly high like a bird up in the sky
