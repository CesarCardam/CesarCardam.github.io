76. Tower Of PowerHipper Than Hip (Yesterday, Today, &amp; Tomorrow)
Ain't nothin' I can say, nothin' I can do,
I feel so bad, yeah, I feel so blue.
I got to make it right for everyone concerned
even if it's me, if it means it's me what's gettin' burned.
'Cause I could never make you unhappy, no, I couldn't do that girl,
only wish I didn't have to love you do, makes it so, so very hard to go.
(backgrounds-So very hard to go)
'Cause I love you so, (backgrounds answer-So very hard to go),
ah, I love you do.
2nd Verse: I knew the time would come,
I'd have to pay for my mistakes,
I can't blame you for what you're doin' to me girl,
even tho' my heart aches.
Your dreams have all come true just the way you planned them,
so I'll just step aside, I'm gon step aside and lend a helping hand then.
'Cause I could never make you unhappy, no I couldn't do that girl,
only wish I didn't love you so, makes it so, so very hard to go.
(Backgrounds-So very hard to go)
'Cause I love you so (backgrounds answer-so very hard to go)
Oh, I love you so (backgrounds answer again-so very hard to go)
And it ain't easy to walk away when a man love some body (so very hard to go) hey, hey, hey, hey.
