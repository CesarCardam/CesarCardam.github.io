I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel, baby
Then, c'mon, oh, c'mon, woo
Let's get it on, ah baby
Ah, baby, let's get it on
Let's love, baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on, woo hoo
We're all sensitive people
With so much to give
Understand me, sugar
Since we've got to be here
Let's live
I love you
There's nothing wrong with me
Loving you, baby no no
And giving yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true, oh baby woo ooo
Don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be woo ooo
I'm asking you baby to get it on with me, ooo ooo ooo
I ain't gonna worry
I ain't gonna push, I won't push you baby
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby
Stop beatin' 'round the bush, heyah
Let's get it on
Let's get it on
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
C'mon, baby, hey hey
Let your love come out
If you believe in love
Let's get it on, ooo

Please, get it on, ahhey
I know, you know, what I've been dreaming of
Don't you baby

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, darlin'
Stop beatin' 'round the bush

Let me groove ya good
Let your love come down

Something like sanctified
