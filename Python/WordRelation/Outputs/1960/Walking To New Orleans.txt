72. Fats DominoThe Legends of New Orleans: Fats Domino Live!
This time I'm walkin' to New Orleans
I'm walkin' to New Orleans
I'm gonna need two pair of shoes
When I get through walkin' these blues
When I get back to New Orleans
I've got my suitcase in my hand
Now ain't that a shame?
I'm leavin' here today
Yes, I'm goin' back home to stay
Yes, I'm walkin to New Orleans
You used to be my honey
Till you spent all my money
No use for you to cry
I'll see you by and by
'Cause I'm walkin' to New Orleans
I've got no time for talkin'
I've go to keep a-walkin'
New Orleans is my home
That's the reason why I'm goin'
Yes, I'm walkin' to New Orleans
I'm walkin' to New Orleans
I'm walkin' to New Orleans
