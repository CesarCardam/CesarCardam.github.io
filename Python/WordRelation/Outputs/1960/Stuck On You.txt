You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake, sugar
But you'll never shake me
Uh-uh-uh
No-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick because I'm
Stuck on you
Gonna run my fingers through your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
Cause once I catch ya, and the kissin' starts
A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart
Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is gonna keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh, Uh-uh-uh
Oh yeah, Uh-uh-uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
Cause once I catch ya, and the kissin' starts
A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart
Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is gonna keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh, Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Yeah, yeah, because I'm
Stuck on you
I'm gonna stick like glue
Yeah, yeah, because I'm
Stuck on you
I'm gonna stick like glue
Yeah, yeah, because I'm
Stuck on you
