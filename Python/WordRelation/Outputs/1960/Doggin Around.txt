95. Jackie Wilsonalbum
You better stop, yeah, doggin' me around.
If you don't stop. yeah, I'm gonna put you down.
'Cause I can't take it much longer.
My heart is gettin' weak.
It's not gettin' any stronger.
You keep me so upset.
My head's in a whirl.
But if you wanna be my girl,
You better stop, yeah, doggin' me around.
'Cause if you don't stop, I'm gonna put you down.
Now I know you go out nights
To have yourself a ball.
And sometimes you don't, you don't make it home at all.
I don't mind havin' yourself a real good time.
But now what you're tryin' to do,
Tryin' to make me lose my mind.
You better stop, yeah, doggin' me around.
'Cause if you don't stop, I'm gonna put you down.
Yes, I'll put you down.
I don't wanna do it, but I'll put you down.
I love you, but still I'll put you down.
