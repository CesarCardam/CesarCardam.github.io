And they called it puppy love
Oh I guess they'll never know
How a young heart how it really feels
And why I love her so
And they called it puppy love
Just because we're seventeen
Tell them all
Oh please tell them it isn't fair
To take away my only dream
I cry each night
It's tears for you
My tears are all in vain
I hope I hope and I pray
That maybe someday
You'll be back (you'll be back) in my arms (in my arms)
Once again
Someone help me
Help me please
Is the answer, is it up above?
How can I
Oh how can I ever tell them?
This is not a puppy love
(This is not a puppy love)
