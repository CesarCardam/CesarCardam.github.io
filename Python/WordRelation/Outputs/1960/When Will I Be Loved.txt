91. Everly Brothersalbum
I've been made blue, I've been lied to
When will I be loved
I've been turned down, I've been pushed around
When will I be loved
When I meet a new girl that I want for mine
She always breaks my heart in two, it happens every time
I've been cheated, been mistreated
When will I be loved
When I meet a new girl that I want for mine
She always breaks my heart in two, it happens every time
I've been cheated, been mistreated
When will I be loved
When will I be loved
