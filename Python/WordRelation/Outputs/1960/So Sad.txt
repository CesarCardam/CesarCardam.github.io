70. Everly Brothersalbum
We used to have good times together
But now I feel them slip away
It makes me cry to see love die
So sad to watch good love go bad
Remember how you used to feel, dear
You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad
Is it any wonder that I feel so blue ue, ue
When I know for certain that I'm losing you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
Remember how you used to feel, dear
You said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part
So sad to watch good love go bad
