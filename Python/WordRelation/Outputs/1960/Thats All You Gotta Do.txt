71. Brenda Lee20th Century Masters: The Best Of Brenda Lee (Millenium Collection)
Anytime you're feeling low
And you got no place to go
You don't have to be blue
Here is all you gotta do
Call me on the telephone
Tell me that you're all alone
And I'll come a runnin' to you
Baby that's all you gotta do
All you gotta do when you're lonesome
Is to call on me
And I'll come a runnin' to you
As a fast as I can
I'll love and squeeze you, uh-huh-huh
I'll try to please you
'Cause baby, I want you to be my lovin' man
I've been waiting for the chance
Needing you to start a romance
And if you feel the same way too
Here's all you gotta do
Tell me just a how you feel
Tell me that your love is real
And I'll give my heart to you
Baby, that's all you gotta do
All you gotta do when you're lonesome
Is to call on me
And I'll come a runnin' to you
As a fast as I can, uh-huh-huh
I'll love and squeeze you, uh-huh-huh
I'll try to please you
'Cause baby, I want you to be my lovin' man
