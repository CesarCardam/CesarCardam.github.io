When somebody leaves you, that's the time to cry
When you know you're lonely, you're not the one and only
Who will cry?
When your heart is broken, that's the time to cry
When you know she's left you, you'll know that she has left you
So you can cry
Happiness is what I long for
Loneliness is why I cry
For you have made my heart a slave
And now it's up to you
When somebody leaves you, that's the time to cry
When you know she's left you, you'll know that she has left you
So you can cry
