Chicks (ah)
Kicks (ah)
Cats (ah)
Cool (ah)
Ah, school
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I go a swingin' school
(La, la-la-la, la, la, la)
Where the chicks are kicks
And the cats are cool
(La, la-la-la, la, la, la)
Well we dance the greatest
And we dress the latest
Whoa-whoa-whoa
I go a swingin' school
(Ah, Bobby, ah)
(Everythings cool), that's cool
(We're glad you go to a swingin' school)
My little chick is my heart's desire
(La, la-la-la, la, la, la)
Well the way we kiss
It puts the school on fire
(La, la-la-la, la, la, la)
Ah, chicks (ah)
Kicks (ah)
Cats (ah)
Cool (ah)
Yeah, school (aaah, ah, ah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
[Instrumental Interlude]
(Whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
(Ah
(Ah)
After school we have to rendezvous
(La, la-la-la, la, la, la)
Gonna plan all the things
That we're gonna do
(La, la-la-la, la, la, la)
Trade bookin' for cookin'
And I'll quit my lookin'
When our days at the school are through
(Ah, Bobby, ah)
(Everythings cool, that's cool)
(We're glad you go to a swingin' school)
We live and love by the golden rule
(La, la-la-la, la, la, la)
We're gonna settle down
At a swingin' school
(La, la-la-la, la, la, la)
Well have a house and car
A swimmin' pool
Whoa-whoa-whoa
I go a swingin' school
(La, la-la-la, la, la, la)
I said, a whoa-whoa-whoa
I go a swingin' school
