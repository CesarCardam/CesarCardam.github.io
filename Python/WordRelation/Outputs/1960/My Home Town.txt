77. Paul AnkaThe Real...
I took a little trip to my home town
I only stopped to look around
And as I walked along the thorough-fare
There was music playing ev'rywhere
The music came from within my heart
How did it happen how did it start
I only know that I fell in love
I guess the answer lies up above
Oh what a feeling
My heart was reeling
The bells were ringing
The birds were singing
And so the music keep goes on and on
And through the night until the break of dawn
I hear a bird up in the tree
He sings a pretty little melody
Oh what a feeling
My heart was reeling
The bells were ringing
The birds were singing
