Ah
I've traveled far, the land and the sea
Beautiful places I happened to be
One little town I'll never forget
Is Lourdes, the village of Saint Bernadette
Ave, ave, ave Maria
Ave, ave, ave Maria
There, like a dream, this wonderful night
I gazed at the grotto aglow in the light
A feeling divine swept over me there
I fell to my knees as I whispered the prayer
Ave, ave, ave Maria
Ave, ave, ave Maria
Now I am home, I'm happy to be
Telling of places I've traveled to see
One little town I'll never forget
Is Lourdes, the village of Saint Bernadette
Ave, ave, ave Maria
Ave, ave, ave Maria
Ave, ave, ave Maria
Ave, ave, ave Maria
