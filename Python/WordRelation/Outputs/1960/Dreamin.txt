Dreamin' I'm always dreamin'
Dreamin' love will be mine
Searchin' I'm always searchin'
Hopin' someday I'll find
Someone, someone to love me
Someone to need me but until then
Well I'll keep on dreamin'
Keep right on dreamin'
Dreamin' till my dreamin' comes true ue ue ue ue ue ue ue...
Dreamin' I'm always dreamin'
Dreamin' love will be mine
Searchin' I'm always searchin'
Hopin' someday I'll find
Someone, someone to needs me
Someone to love me but until then
Well I'll keep on dreamin'
Keep right on dreamin'
Dreamin' till my dreamin' comes true ue ue ue...
Well I'll keep on dreamin'
I got 'll keep on dreamin'
I got 'll keep...
