18. Brenda Lee20th Century Masters: The Best Of Brenda Lee (Millenium Collection)
Uh huh, honey alright
My baby whispers in my ear
Mm sweet nothin's
He knows the things I like to hear
Mm sweet nothin's
Things he wouldn't tell nobody else
secret baby I keep them to myself
Sweet nothin's um sweet nothin's
We walk along hand in hand
Mm sweet nothin's
Yeah we both understand
Mm sweet nothin's
Sittin' in a classroom tryin' to read my book
my baby gives me that special look
Sweet nothin's, mm sweet nothin's
Ah, sittin' on my front porch
Mm sweet nothin's
Well do I love you of course
Mm sweet nothin's
Mama turned on the front porch light
Sayin' come here darlin' that's enough for tonight
Sweet nothin's
Mm sweet nothin's, sweet nothin's
Mm sweet nothin's, sweet nothin's
