68. Connie FrancisThe Complete US Singles As &amp; Bs: 1955-62
When the evening shadows fall
And the lovely day is through,
Then with longing I recall
The years I spent with you.
Mama, I miss the days
When you were near to guide me,
Mama, those happy days
When you were here beside me.
Safe in the glow of your love,
Sent from the heavens above,
Nothing can ever replace
The warmth of your tender embrace.
Oh, Mama, until the day
That we're together once more,
I'll live in these memories
Until the day that we're together once more.
