99. Charlie RichLonely Weekends
Well I'm makin' alright (Well I'm makin' alright)
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends
Since you left me (since you left me)
I'm as lonely as I can be
Oh, those lonely weekends
You said you'd be (ooh-wah) good to me (ooh-wah-wah)
You said our love (ooh-wah) would never die (ooh-wah-wah)
You said you'd be (ooh-wah) good to me (ooh-wah-wah)
But baby, you didn't even try
Well I'm makin' alright (Well I'm makin' alright)
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends
You said you'd be (ooh-wah) good to me (ooh-wah-wah)
You said our love (ooh-wah) would never die (ooh-wah-wah)
You said you'd be (ooh-wah) good to me (ooh-wah-wah)
But baby, you didn't even try
Well I'm makin' alright (Well I'm makin' alright)
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends
Oh, those lonely weekends
Oh, those lonely weekends
