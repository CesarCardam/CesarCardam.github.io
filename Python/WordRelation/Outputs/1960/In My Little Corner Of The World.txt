94. Anita Bryantalbum
Come along with me,
To my little corner of the world,
And dream a little dream,
In my little corner of the world.
Tonight my love,
We'll share a sweet embrace,
We'll soon forget,
There's any other place.
(Chorus)
And if you care to stay,
In my little corner of the world,
Then we can hide away,
In my little corner of the world.
I always knew,
I'd find someone like you,
So welcome to,
My little corner of the world.
(Repeat from chorus)
