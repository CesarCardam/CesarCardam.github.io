Don't want your love anymore,
Don't want your kisses that's for sure,
I die each time I hear this sound,
Here he comes that's Cathy's clown
I gotta stand tall
You know a man can't crawl,
When he knows your tellin' lies and
He hears 'em passing by, he's
Not a man at all
Don't want your love anymore,
Don't want your kisses that's for sure,
I die each time I hear this sound,
Here he comes that's Cathy's clown
When you see me shed a tear,
And you know that it's sincere
Don't you think it's kinda sad that
You're treating me so bad or don't
You even care?
Don't want your love anymore,
Don't want your kisses that's for sure,
I die each time I hear this sound,
Here he comes that's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clown
