76. Neil SedakaHits Around the World
Climb up, way up high
Climb up, way up high
Climb up, way up high
Well a, well a, well a, heavenly angel
I want you for my girl
When I kissed your sweet, sweet lips
I knew that you were out of this world
I'll build a stairway to heaven
I'll climb to the highest star
I'll build a stairway to heaven
Cause heaven is where you are
Well a, well a, well a, over the rainbow
That's where I'm gonna climb
Way up high where the bluebirds fly
I'm gonna love you all the time
I'll build a stairway to heaven
I'll climb to the highest star
I'll build a stairway to heaven
Cause heaven is where you are
I'll build a stairway to heaven
I'll climb to the highest star
I'll build a stairway to heaven
Cause heaven is where you are
Well a, well a, well a, I gotta be going
Gonna leave the world behind
Every day in a heavenly way
You're gonna drive me outta my mind
I'll build a stairway to heaven
I'll climb to the highest star
I'll build a stairway to heaven
Cause heaven is where you are
I'll build a stairway to heaven
Cause heaven is where you are
Clim up, way up high
Clim up, way up high
Clim up, way up high...
