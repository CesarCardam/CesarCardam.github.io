43. Brenda Lee20th Century Masters: The Best Of Brenda Lee (Millenium Collection)
(Wanted, wanted)
Alone, so alone that I could cry
I want to be wanted (wanted)
Alone, watching lovers passing by
I want to be wanted
When I am Kissed
I want his lips to really kiss me
When we're apart
I want his heart to really miss me
I want to know he loves me so his eyes are misting
That's the way, I want to be loved
Alone, just my lonely heart knows how
I want to be wanted (wanted) right now
Not tomorrow, but right now
I want to be wanted
I want someone to share my laughter and my tears with
Someone I know I'd love to spend a million years with
Where is this someone somewhere meant for me
Alone, just my lonely heart knows how
I want to be wanted (wanted) right now
Not tomorrow, but right now
I want to be wanted
I want someone to share my laughter and my tears with
Someone I know I'd love to spend a million years with
Where is this someone somewhere meant for me (someone, somewhere)
Meant for me
