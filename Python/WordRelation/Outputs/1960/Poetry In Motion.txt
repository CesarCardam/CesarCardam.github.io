When I see my baby
What do I see
Poetry
Poetry in motion
Poetry in motion
Walkin' by my side
Her lovely locomotion
Keeps my eyes open wide
Poetry in motion
See her gentle sway
A wave out on the ocean
Could never move that way
I love every movement
And there's nothing I would change
She doesn't need improvement
She's much too nice to rearrange
Poetry in motion
Dancing close to me
A flower of devotion
A swaying gracefully
Whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa
Poetry in motion
See her gentle sway
A wave out on the ocean
Could never move that way
I love every movement
There's nothing I would change
She doesn't need improvement
She's much too nice to rearrange
Poetry in motion
All that I adore
No number-nine love potion
Could make me love her more
Whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
