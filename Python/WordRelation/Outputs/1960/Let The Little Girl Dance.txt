(Little wallflower on the shelf, standing by herself)
(Never had the nerve to take a chance, so let the little girl dance)
Let the little girl dance, let the little girl dance
She never danced before so let her on the floor (so let her on the floor)
Let the little girl dance, let the little girl dance
She wants to give it a try, so let the little girl by (so let the little girl by)
Shes been a little wallflower on the shelf, standing by herself
Now she got the nerve to take a chance, so let the little girl dance
Let the little girl through, she wants to pass by you
Buddy, cant you see she wants to dance with me (she wants to dance with me)
