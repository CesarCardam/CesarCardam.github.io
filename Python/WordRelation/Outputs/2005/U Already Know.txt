Papa comin' over to give you that raw
Favorite position is from the backdoor
Girl you know the drill don't ask no questions

I'm trying to give you that thing to make you say
From the kitchen floor down to the fireplace
Incense burning your body is talking that shit to me
Cancel that phone only sound I'm tryin' 2 hear is your moan
You riding topless no panties on
And I've been thinking bout this all day long
