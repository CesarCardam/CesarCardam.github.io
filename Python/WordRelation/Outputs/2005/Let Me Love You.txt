Baby, I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume
The make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around
And I just don't know why
If I was ya man, baby you'd
Never worry bout, what I do
I'd be coming home, back to you
Every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman, deserves good things
Fist full of diamonds, hand full of rings
Baby, you're a star, I just want to show you, you are
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you, love you, love you
Love you, yeah
Listen
Your true beauty's description
Looks so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus ninety-nine
And it's a shame don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go they stop and stare
'Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes, out of control, baby you know
If I was ya man, baby you'd
Never worry bout, what I do
I'd be coming home, back to you
Every night, doin' you right
You're the type of woman, deserves good things
Fist full of diamonds, hand full of rings
Baby, you're a star, I just want to show you, you are
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Ooh baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me
You deserve better girl, you know you deserve better
We should be together girl, baby
With me and you it's whatever girl, hey
So can we make this thing ours?
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be, yeah
Let me love you
That's all you need, baby
