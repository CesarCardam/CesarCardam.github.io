33. Frankie J Featuring Baby BashThe One
(Check check ...this happened for real ...baby bash..yeah..Frankie J.... obession)
Well It's early in the morning
And my heart is feelin lonely
Just thinkin 'bout you baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I dont know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if its right
I'm tossin turning in my bed
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I dont know what to do
I think I'm in love
Baby....
[Chorus]
Amor..no es amor(if this ain't love)
then what am I feeling what am I doing wrong
Amor...no es amor(if this ain't love)
is this an illusion that I have in my heart
Now I know you're not my lady but I'm tryin to make this right
I dont know what to do I'm going out of my mind
So baby if you let me could kick it wit you then will maybe we could ride together
We could do this all night now I don't care if you got a man
Baby I wish you'd understand
'cause I know he can't love you right, quite like I can
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless at home
I don't know what to do
I think I'm in love
[Chorus]
Amor..no es amor (if this ain't love)
then what am I feeling what am I doing wrong
Amor..no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart
(ooo)I love the way you freaky like that
(ooo)I love the way you freaky like that
(ooo)I love the way you freaky like that
It's an obsession
[Baby Bash]
Hold up let me dream
Shorty got me feelin serene
you're my candy, you're my cream
Got your boy feel less supreme
Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent
Love everything your representing
Got alot of money and I love to spend it
And that's what's up and I don't care what people scream
you're my blessin' when I'm stressin'
My superfly beauty queen
I'ma keep it saucy
'cause my mama know how I do, we go rendez-vous, mi corazon belongs to you
[Chorus]
Amor..no es amor(if this ain't love)
then what am I feeling what am I doing wrong what am I doin' wrong [echo]
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart
Amor..no es amor (if this ain't love)
What am I feelling? what am I doing wrong? what am I doin' so wrong? [echo]
Amor..no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart
Amor
