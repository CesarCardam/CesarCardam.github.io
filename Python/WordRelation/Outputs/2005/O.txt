Whoa whoa whoa
Hey here I go(Here I go)
I know you heard men saying time and time again
That they would rock your world and change your life
But I can't blame them cause you make a nigga want to get involved
want to get them drawers
Well I'm gonna put my bid in and get at you
No disrespect but I want it bad as they do
The only differences is they look out for themselves
But I'm doing it just to hear you yell
ooooooo
It's gonna be the sound girl when its going down Your body saying
ooooooo
Don't have to say my name girl I'm just glad you came ,So you can say
ooooooo

In the night
You say O means, always hitting it right
ooooooo
You can't be mad at me
I'm just aiming to please
Girl come on over and lets get this thing crackin
You'll be surprised when you see what O's i'm packing
Cause I'm young but I'm ready
Tryin' get hot and heavy, Turn you out if you let me(yeah yeah yeah)
Girl I'm gonna take you somewhere that you never been
Show you somethings that will make you want to show your friends
Have you so weak that you can't say a thing
But that's OK all you gotta say is

We'll go for hours take a break and go at it again
Girl I'll work my way from A all the way to Z
But trust me baby girl O is where you want to be
Girl believe me when I tell you I'm not tryin' tell you what to do
Because when it's said and done, The choice ain't mine it's really up to you
Just say yes, Don't fix your mouth to tell me no
Drop that bottom jaw for me
And just say O

Let me hear you say O when I'm getting it
Let me hear you say O when you come to the door
Let me hear you say O from the bed to the floor
Let me hear you say O when its all going down
Let me hear you say O when you can't make another sound
Baby girl let me hear you scream O
Baby girl let me hear you scream O
