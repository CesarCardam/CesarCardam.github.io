62. Baby Bash Featuring AkonSuper Saucy
Don't look no farther!
Baby I'm back (yeah)
I'm here to cater to you (any thing that you want me: do ill do it)
Cause Ill be your lover (ill be your lover)
Ill be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do (tell me what I gotta do and ill do it)
Now I'm back in a flesh
Feelin' so blessed, back in your corner suga, suga don't stress
Forget about the rest; let's go inside, I'm back in your zone
Baby I'm back in your vibe, now I can't be denied I can lie I'm on ya
I never ever want to say sayonara
Some body told me that the grass was greener
On the other side of lake haewa
Never really used to be a mean to cheat her
What I gotta do to be a keeper
These words comin' out the speaker, true love is off the meter
Don't look no farther!
Baby I'm back (yeah)
I'm here to cater to you (any thing that you want me: do ill do it)
Cause Ill be your lover (ill be your lover)
Ill be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do (tell me what I gotta do and ill do it)
I was gone for a minute but now I'm home,
Kids forget me for being a rolling stone,
Please forgive me let me polish it up like chrome,
Get off the phone till he swears to leave me alone,
Let my start your interest, now there's no more dating on the internet,
'Cause you already know how I get it wet, how I get it so salty and I get respect,
You don't have to look no farter, you dealin with the hoe with your lada,
You don't have to look no farther, you hotter then a fire starter
Don't look no farther!
Baby I'm back (yeah)
I'm here to cater to you (any thing that you want me: do ill do it)
Cause Ill be your lover (ill be your lover)
Ill be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do (tell me what I gotta do and ill do it)
I was gone for a minute, (oooohhh)
I was gone for a minute, (oooohhh)
I was gone for a minute, (oooohhh)
Now I'm back let me hit it (oooohhh) [repeat x4]
Now I'm back let me hit it (oooohhh) [repeat x4]
Now I'm back let me hit it (oooohhh) [repeat x4]
Now I'm back let me hit it (oooohhh) [repeat x4]
