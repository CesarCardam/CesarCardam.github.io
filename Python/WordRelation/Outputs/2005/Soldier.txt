Walk the streets five deep with nothing less than a stack

Hey, see cash money is a army
I'm walking with purple hearts on me
You talking to the sergeant
Body marked up like the subway in Harlem
Call him, Weezy F. baby, please say the baby
If you don't see me on the block I ain't trying to hide
I blend in wit the hood, I'm camouflage
Bandanna tied, so mommy join my troop
Now every time she hear my name she salute!
