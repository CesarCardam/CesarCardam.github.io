80. Natasha BedingfieldUnwritten
(These words are my own, yeah yeah yeah)
Threw some chords together
The combination D.E.F
It's who I am it's what I do
And I was gonna lay it down for you.
I'm trying to focus my attention
But I feel so A.D.D
I need some help some inspiration
But it's not coming easily...
Tryn'a find the magic
Tryn'a write a classic
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know?
Wastebin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see ya later
These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you I love you
I love you I love you!
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you
Read some Byron, Shelly, and Keats
Recited it over a hip hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean
With dead poets and drum machines
You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find the killa hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar
Right up (this is on a separate line!)
Nothing I write is ever good enough
These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you I love you
I love you I love you!
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you
These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you I love you
I love you I love you!
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you (love you)
I'm getting of my stage
The curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked sole's expos√©
Whoah oh oh oh (etc etc etc)
Tryn'a find the magic
Tryn'a write a classic
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know?
Wastebin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see ya later
These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you I love you
I love you I love you!
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you (love you)
These words are my own
From my heart flown
They're from my heart
I love you I love you
I love you I love you!
There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you (love you)
These words are my own
They're from my heart
I love you I love you
That's all I got to say
Can't think of a better way
That's all I got to say
I love you is that ok?
