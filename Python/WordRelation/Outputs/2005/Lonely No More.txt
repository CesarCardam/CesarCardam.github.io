22. Rob ThomasSomething to Be [DUALDISC]
Now it seems to me
That you know just what to say
But words are only words
Can you show me something else?
Can you swear to me
That you'll always be this way?
Show me how you feel
More then ever, baby
I don't want to be lonely no more
I don't want to have to pay for this
I don't want another lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list
I don't want to be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me now for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Whoa, oh
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Now it's hard for me
When my heart's still on the mend
Open up to me
Like you do your girlfriends
And you sing to me
And it's harmony
Girl, what you do to me is everything
If you say anything, just to get you back again
Why can't we just try?
I don't want to be lonely no more
I don't want to have to pay for this
I don't want another lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list
I don't want to be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me now for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore
What if I was good to you?
What if you were good to me?
What if I could hold you
Till I feel you move inside me?
What if it was Paradise?
What if we were symphonies?
What if I gave all my life to find some way to stand beside you?
I don't want to be lonely no more
I don't want to have to pay for this
I don't want another lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list
I don't want to be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me now for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore
