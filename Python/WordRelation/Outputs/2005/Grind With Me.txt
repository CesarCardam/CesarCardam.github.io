Baby grind on me
Relax your mind take your time on me
Let me get deeper shorty ride on me
Now come and sex me till yo body gets weak
We're slow grindin' baby
Grind on me
Relax your mind take your time on me
Let me get deeper shorty ride on me
Now come and sex me till yo body gets weak
We're slow grindin' baby
When I get 'em I make 'em say (oh)
Sex be my day (job)
I hit 'em the back of my (car)
Make 'em ride like a see (saw)
I make 'em laugh and giggle
Cuddle a little
Suck on a nipple, lick!
The whip cream from the middle
Girlfriend I never go raw
I rip off panties and I pop off bras
B-L-U-E-S-T-A-R
Ask around the block how freaky we (are)
I drink red bull so I keep stamina
Bustin' ya brain
What's my name
What's my name
What's my name
Pretty Ricky pretty boy
Doing pretty good things
Making pretty good change
Getting pretty good brains
From these pretty pretty chicks
Getting pretty damn rich
Pretty Ricky Ricky Ricky and the Mavericks

Baby girl five five brown eyes with the thick lips
Thick thighs with the slim hips

Eater her up like a sundae cone

Coochi swollen
The bedroom smoking
Get some air up in this room girl
Ah ah ah ah
If loving you is wrong
