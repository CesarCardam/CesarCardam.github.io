50. Fat Joe Featuring NellyAll or Nothing
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Its 2 up in the mornin' girl and the DJ playin' that song
Now watchu gonna do
I'm gonna get get get it poppin'
Watchu gonna do
I'm gonna get get get it poppin'
I got the unlimited American Express card
Momma you can get whateva ya like
Plus I got that all Black Phantom tinted on four sides
Get a kiss so they can't see us inside
Momma tell me do you like it
I know you like it
Its written all ova your face don't fight it
You like it
More than I like it
So put it all ova your face don't bite it
From rags to riches club packing
Bitches hate the bag and ditch us
The hate game is vicious
And we can get it poppin' to the bathroom
Don't be selfish ma, go ahead and pass it to em
And we can all fuck
Its like a million on my neck
Got all these bitches awestruck
We pissy drunk off of seraphim and I'm up in V.I.P, and these bitches screaming let me in
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Get it poppin' and get droppin'
Its written all ova you're face don't stop it
Just drop it
More like this hopness
Kickin' the dough with the fo fo messin' with Joe
Now this kid gotta ass so fat
In fact, I put a drink on it, I and came right back
He would never talk to a Elaine like that
And my ears screaming how he got a name like Crack Jack
Similar to Mike Jones
Say my name enough then I'm takin' you home
You know I walk when I talk when I sleep with the girl
One squeeze and you gone
What I look like not taking at least
3 to 6 women at the club with me
Now we back to the fuck pad, call it the fuckpad
'Cause all these bitches fuckin' with me
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Now when that door swing open with that awkward motion whatchu
Call it
Suicide, its a suicide
And if the niggas talk shit 'cause they drink off that awkward
Potion they committing
Suicide, its a suicide
Lets get it poppin' up
I gotta shot 'em niggas
I feel sorry for yo motha
Give a fuck what you say
Spin your head back from whatchu wanta video tape
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
