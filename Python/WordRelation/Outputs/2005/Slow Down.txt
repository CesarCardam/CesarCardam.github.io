I slow it down
It's the remix
I can tell you keep yourself up
Hair and nails done plus a good job
Baby, I can tell you from a good home
You're a leader and your head is strong
You're exclusive not many guys
Can say they tapped that
And I like that put your brake on
I'm writing you a ticket
With my name on it plus ten digets
I'm in your city just for the weekend
Relaxation is all I'm seekin'
This walkin' and talkin' ain't doin' it for me
So baby, won't you please turn around?
And slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know you
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know you
Maybe one day we can share a last name
Take trips over seas just to celebrate
When's your birthday? I'm a Pisces
The right zodiac you can be my wifey
Just imagine dress track and
I'm in a tux and almost cryin'
We gettin' married, private ceremony
On the beach just like you told yo mamma, yeah, yeah
I'm in your city just for the weekend
Relaxation is all I'm seekin'
This walkin' and talkin' ain't doin' it for me
So baby, won't you please turn around?
And Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know you
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know you
Just a little while, talk to me
Baby, I'm beggin'
Baby, I'm beggin', beggin', baby
Just a little while, tell me
Baby, I'm beggin'
Baby, I'm beggin', beggin', baby
Just a little while, bless me with your beauty
Baby, I'm beggin'
Baby, I'm beggin', beggin', baby
Just a little while, baby
Baby, I'm beggin'
Baby, I'm beggin', beggin', baby
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know you
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know you
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know you
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know ya
Slow down, I just wanna know you
