I'm sprung,
Dog she got me
Got me doing thing's I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm telling you
I'm sprung,
Dog she got me,
Got me doing thing's I'll never do
If you ain't been I'm telling you
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
You do
I'm sprung,
Dog she got me,
Got me doing thing's I'll never do If you ain't been I'm telling you
I'm sprung,
Dog she got me,
Got me doing thing's I'll never do If you ain't been I'm telling you
You do
You do
You do
You do
You
Do
She got me doing the dishes
Anything she want for some kisses
I'm cooking for her when she gets hungry
All she do is acting like she want me
She cutting off all my homies
Even all my other ronnies
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinking bout it lately
Man she really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her
But now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm taking everything with me
Well it all come down to her
I'm sprung,
Dog she got me,
Got me doing thing's I'll never do If you ain't been I'm telling you
I'm sprung,
Dog she got me,
Got me doing thing's I'll never do If you ain't been I'm telling you
You do
You do
You do
You do
You
Do
So we went our separate ways,
It's been a couple of days,
But now I'm doing what I want to
With nobody telling me what I'm gone do
And I'm feeling so free,
With nobody but me,
Now I can handle all my business
All my fellas can I get a witness
But I'm feeling kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her,
Now I'm leaving quickly,
Before she come and try to get me,
And I'm taking everything with me,
Well it all come down to her
I'm sprung,
Dog she got me,
Got me doing thing's I'll never do If you ain't been I'm telling you
I'm sprung,
Dog she got me,
Got me doing thing's I'll never do If you ain't been I'm telling you
You do
You do
You do
You do
You
Do
