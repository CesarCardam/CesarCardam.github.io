79. T.I.Urban Legend
I'm a tell y'all sucker niggas something
Who wants to follow me
Look here dog
[Chorus]
You might see me in the street
But nigga you don't know me
When ya holla on the street
Remember you don't know me
Save all the hating and the popping
Nigga you don't know me
Quit telling niggas you my partner
Nigga you don't know me
Don't be recruiting keep it moving
Nigga you don't know me
Hey I ain't tripping but the truth is
Really you don't know me
Ya you know they call me T.I.
But you don't know me
You be hating and I see why
Cause you don't know me
I think its time I made a song for niggas who don't know me
I graduated at the streets, I'ma real OG
I been trapping shooting pistols since I stood on both feet
So while you niggas acting bad, you gon have to show me
You gone make me bring a Chevy to a real slow creek
My niggas hanging out the window, mouth full of gold teeth
When the guns start poppin, wonder when its gonna cease
Cap'll hit you on the side and create a slow leak
We been in the speculation cause today we gone see
What's the future of a pussy nigga hating on me
I give a fuck about the feds investigation on me
I don't care they at my shows and they waiting on me
I'ma keep a flossy popping long as to is on the beat
Tell police that I ain't stopping I'ma keep it in the streets
Contrary to yo believes, I'm as real as you can be
Fuck yo thoughts and yo feelings nigga you don't know me.
[Chorus]
Hey once again let me remind you nigga you don't know me
So don't be walking up and asking what's the deal on a Ki.
I don't know if you wearing wires you could be the police
If I was slanging dope you couldn't get an OZ
See me at the PSC follow through and the show deep
Hommies holding up the doe, 'cause they know we toat heat
I just want to wrap a see, blow a dro ina flee
Only playing bout a dozen different pictures in a week
I just want to chill with country and his daddy Freddy G
Balling out everytime, every stone is but a G
Want to ball in the Bahamas curtousy of KT
Fact I only gotta Mill. as well as a dollar DP
AK house on the hill right next to JG
Every week be there for lunch, busta blunt and eat free
Get in day paid Lil Craig dead meat
That's the only shot we got at getting cap back on the streets
[Chorus]
You see a nigga hating on a G
Ask em what's it gonna be
What looking at, pussy nigga you don't know me
At the club, in the streets
Or where ever we should meet
It's choppa chopping pistols popping nigga you don't know me [Repeat: x2]
[Chorus]
