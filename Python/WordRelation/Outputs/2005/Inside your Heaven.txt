71. Carrie UnderwoodSome Hearts
I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around
I guess it's right; it's so amazing
Every time I see you I'm alive
You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
When we touch, when we love
The stars light up
The wrong becomes undone
Naturally, my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holdin' you until the day I die
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
(I wanna be inside your heaven)
Wanna be inside
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in
A soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
