Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (hah hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath (hah hah)
Ooh
I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to
Now you want to act like ya don't know what to do
After I done everything that you ask me
Grabbed you, grinded you, liked you, tried you
Move so fast baby now I can't find you
Ooh
I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk but it seems like it can't come through
All those times if you could satisfy me
Now I see where believing you got me,
Gave you the wheel but you can't drive me
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (hah hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath (hah hah)
Ooh
Two things I don't like when I'm trying to get my groove
Is a partner that meets only halfway and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction
Ooh
You understand the facts that I'm tryna give to you
Ya movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
Learn the difference of a man and an adolescent
Ain't you boo, so get to stepping
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (hah hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath (hah hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (hah hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath (hah hah)
If you can't make me say ooh
Like the beat of this drum
Why you askin' for some
You don't really want none
If you can't make me say ooh
Like the beat of this groove
You don't have no business in this
Here's your papers baby you are dismissed
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (hah hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath (hah hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (hah hah)
Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath (hah hah)
