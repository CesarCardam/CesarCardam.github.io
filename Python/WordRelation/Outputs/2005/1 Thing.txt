67. AmerieBecause I Love It
Oh, been trying to let it go
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Trying to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak
Don't want to tell you what it is
Oh wee it felt so serious
Got me thinking just too much
I want to set it off, but
It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin'
It's this 1 thing that?s got me trippin' (you did)
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that caught me slippin'
It's this 1 thing don't want to admit it
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh oh
Hey, we don't know each other well
So what? I keep thinking to myself
Memories just keep ringing bells
Hear voices I don?t want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clicking towards your door.
It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin'
It's this 1 thing that?s got me trippin' (you did)
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that caught me slippin'
It's this 1 thing don't want to admit it
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh oh
Maybe I just can?t believe it
It's this one thing you did oh oh
I can't deny, tired of trying
Open up the door, but just keep on seeing you
I'm hoping you can keep a secret
For me, for me, for me
But what you did, yeah
It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin'
It's this 1 thing that?s got me trippin' (you did)
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that caught me slippin'
It's this 1 thing don't want to admit it
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh oh
It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin'
It's this 1 thing that?s got me trippin' (you did)
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that caught me slippin'
It's this 1 thing don't want to admit it
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh oh
It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin'
It's this 1 thing that?s got me trippin' (you did)
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
It's this 1 thing that caught me slippin'
It's this 1 thing don't want to admit it
This 1 thing and I was so with it
It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh oh
