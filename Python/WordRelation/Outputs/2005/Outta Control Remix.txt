[Chorus]
I know somethin' you didn't know
I make you beg for more
Everybody's on the floor
Goin', goin' outta control
Set it off from your left dog
Set it off from your right dog
Set it off nigga I said set if off
Sick with it boy, better get wit it what
In the club, I get it goin' goin' uhh
Just move it to the music its on
To the sound of 50 MPRE
Every things calculated in time precised
Never move another mill let's get right alright
This test is my ? choice I'm high off life
Feelin' lucky enough to bet it all on the dice
Shorty do what you want to do
Hit the dance floor, move how you want to move
Later on, we can cruise if you want to cruise
Its whatever you want, the fact is I got more than I flaunt
[Chorus]
Set it off from your left dog
Set it off from your right dog
Set it off nigga I said set if off
System thumpin', dance floor jumpin'
We thirty deep in this bitch, we stuntin'
that's what you get, you in my hood
I thought you understood
You know me, VIP, no ID
Bottles in DP, I do it real BIG
Bitches break their necks to be where I be
Take 'em to ecstacy without ecstacy
I'm the chef, you need a hit, I got the recipe
Doc got the antedote and send the drugs in the nose
Can you feel it, Slim said for me to make ya feel it
And remind you that you rockin' with the realest
[Chorus]
Set it off from your left dog
Set it off from your right dog
Set it off nigga I said set if off
I'm hot boy, I'm burnin' up
I do my thing in the club with the burner tongue
Till the speakers all blown we gon' turn it up
And do that damn thing, yeah do that man
Shorty, hit me high, then hit me low
Get to poppin' and shakin' that thing on the flo'
A little dose of it, now I want some more
No body put that thang on me like that before
I be a fiend for it, its the way you move
But I ain't payin' for it, cause I ain't no fool
If you okay with it, tonight I'll stay with it
Hit the telly, play wit it, in a major way get it
[Chorus]
Set it off from your left dog
Set it off from your right dog
Set it off nigga I said set if off
