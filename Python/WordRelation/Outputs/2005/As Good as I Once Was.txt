She said I've seen you in here before,
I said I've been here a time or two,
She said hello my name is Bobbi Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight,
You're the only cowboy in this place,
If your up for a rodeo,
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face.
I said girls,
I ain't as good as I once was,
I got a few years on me now,
But there was a time,
Back in my prime,
When I could really lay it down,
If you need some love tonight,
Then I might have just enough,
I ain't as good once was,
But I'm as good once, as I ever was.
I still hang out with my best friend Dave,
I've known him since we were kids at school.
Last night he had a few shots,
Got in a tight spot
Hustling a game of pool,
With a couple of red neck boys,
And one great big fat biker man,
I heard David yell across the room,
Hey Buddy how bout a helping hand.
I said Dave!
I ain't as good as I once was,
My how the years have flown,
But there was a time,
Back in my prime,
When I could really hold my own,
But if you want a fight tonight,
Guess those boys don't look all that tough,
I ain't as good once was,
But I'm as good once, as I ever was.
I used to be hell on wheels,
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says "Oh, You can't do this boy",
But my pride says "Oh yes you can"
I ain't as good as I once was,
That's just the cold, hard truth,(huh)
I still throw a few back,
Talk a little smack,
When I'm feeling bullet proof,
So don't double, dog dare me now,
Cause I'd have to call your bluff,
I ain't as good as I once once was,
But I'm as good once, as I ever was.
May not be good as I once was,
But I'm as good once, as I ever was
