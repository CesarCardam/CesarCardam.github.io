90. Rodney AtkinsTake A Back Road
Sittin' in six lane backed up traffic
Horns a honkin', I've about had it I'm lookin' for an exit sign
Gotta get outta here, get it all off my mind
Then like a memory from your grandpa's attic
A song comes slippin' through the radio static
Changin' my mood, a little George Strait 1982
And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two lane country who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take, makes me wanna take a back road
I've been cooped up, tied down 'bout forgotten
what a field looks like full of corn and cotton
If I'm gonna hit a traffic jam
Well it better be a tractor man
So sick and tired of this interstate system
I need the curvin', windin', twistin' dusty path to nowhere
With the wind blowin' through my baby's hair
Yeah it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two lane country who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take, makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road
Maybe it's the feelin'
Or maybe it's the freedom
Maybe it's that shady spot
Where we park the truck when things get hot
Girl we park the truck when things get hot
And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab you honey
Tear down some two lane country who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take, makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road
Get back with my soul
All I gotta do is take some old back road
To the shady spot where things get hot girl
Way down, way down, way down some old back road
