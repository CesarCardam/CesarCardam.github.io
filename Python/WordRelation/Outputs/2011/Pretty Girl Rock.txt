(Uh uh uh uh ah
Uh uh do the pretty girl rock rock rock
To the pretty girl rock rock rock
Now what's your name)
My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly, oh my, it's a lil' bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at my derri-
Ere, you can stare but if you touch it I'ma bury
Pretty as a picture, sweeter than a swisher
Mad cause I'm cuter than the girl that's witchya
I don't gotta talk about it, baby you can see it
But if you want, I'll be happy to repeat it
My name is Keri, I'm so very
Fly, oh my, it's a lil' bit scary
Boys wanna marry, looking at my derri-
Ere, you can stare but if you touch it I'ma bury
Pretty as a picture, Sweeter than a swisher
Mad cause I'm cuter than the girl that's witchya
I can talk about it cause I know that I'm pretty
And if you know it too, then ladies sing it with me

Aye, now do the pretty girl rock rock rock rock rock
Do the pretty girl rock rock rock rock rock
Do the pretty girl rock rock rock
All my ladies do the pretty girl rock rock rock
Do the pretty girl rock rock rock
Do the pretty girl rock rock rock
Do the pretty girl rock
(Now where you at)
If you're looking for me you can catch me (pass by)
Cameras flashing
Bet he turn his head just as soon as I pass him
Girls think I'm conceited cause I know I'm attractive
Don't worry about what I think, why don't you ask him (oh)
Get yourself together don't hate (never do it)
Jealousy's the ugliest trait (don't ever do it)
I can talk about it cause I know that I'm pretty
And if you know it too, then ladies sing it with me
All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a ten
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
My walk, my talk, the way I dress
It's not my fault so please don't trip
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
All eyes on me when I walk in
No question that this girl's a ten
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
My walk, my talk, the way I dress
It's not my fault so please don't trip
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful
