27. Britney SpearsFemme Fatale Deluxe Version
This kitten's got your tongue tied in knots, I see
Spit it out 'cause I'm dying for company
I notice that you got it
You notice that I want it
You know that I can take it
To the next level, baby
If you want this good, bitch
Sicker than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind
Tonight
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
C'mon get me, get me on the floor
DJ whatcha, whatcha waitin' for?
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Watch me move, when I lose, when I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch dancin' in the dark
You notice what I'm wearing,
I noticing when you're staring
You know that I can take it,
To the next level, baby
Hotter than the A-list,
Next one on my hit list
Baby, let me blow your mind
Tonight
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
C'mon get me, get me on the floor
DJ whatcha, whatcha waitin' for?
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
See that sunlight, we ain't stopping
Keep on dancin' 'till the world ends
If you feel it let it happen
Keep on dancin' till the world ends
Keep on dancin' till the world ends
Keep on dancin' till the world ends
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
See that sunlight, we ain't stopping
Keep on dancin' till the world ends
If you feel it let it happen
Keep on dancin' till the world ends
