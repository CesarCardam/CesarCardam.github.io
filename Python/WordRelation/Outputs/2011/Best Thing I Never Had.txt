What goes around comes back around
(Hey my baby)
What goes around comes back around
(Hey my baby)
I say what goes around comes back around
(Hey my baby)
What goes around comes back around
There was a time
I thought that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy I, must've been outta my mind
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
So baby good lookin' out
I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
You turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
Oh I bet it sucks to be you right now
So sad you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and baby yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
Thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you
Baby good lookin' out
I wanted you bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
I said you turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
Hmm, and I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place
Another time, another world, another life
Thank God I found the good in goodbye
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
Oh you turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
Oh and I will always be the best thing you never had
Ooh best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad
I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
Oh you turned out to be the
Best thing I never had
Whoa, I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now
(What goes around comes back around)
(What goes around comes back around)
Bet it sucks to be you right now
(What goes around comes back around)
Bet it sucks to be you right now
(What goes around comes back around)
Bet it sucks to be you right now
