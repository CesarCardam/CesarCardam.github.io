43. Jason AldeanMy Kinda Party
Yeah I'm chilling on a dirt road,
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Has got me reminiscing on the good times
I'm turning off the real life, driving, that's right
I'm hittin' easy street in mud tires
Back in the day pop's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up hit the dirt road,
Jump the barbwire spread the word
Light the bonfire then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack and Jim were a few good men
When we learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something ya'll don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Man mind your business watch your mouth
Before I have to knock your loud mouth out
I'm tired of talking man ya'll ain't listenin'
Them old dirt roads is what ya'll missin'
Yeah I'm chilling on a dirt road,
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Has got me reminiscing on the good times
I'm turning off the real life, driving, that's right
I'm hittin' easy street in mud tires
I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
If it's broke round here we fix it
I can take ya'll where you need to go
Down to my hood and back in them woods
We do it different 'round here that's right
And we sure do it good and we do it all night
So if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with a truck and four wheel
Jump on in tell yo' friends
And we'll be raising hell where the black top ends
I'm chilling on a dirt road,
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones,
Smoke rollin' out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Has got me reminiscing on the good times
I'm turning off the real life, driving, that's right
I'm hittin' easy street in mud tires that's right
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road,
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin out the window,
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
Has got me reminiscing on the good times
I'm turning off the real life, driving, that's right
I'm hittin' easy street in mud tires that's right
