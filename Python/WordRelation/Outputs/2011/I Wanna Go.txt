46. Britney SpearsFemme Fatale Deluxe Version
Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told do what you do with it
We keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa
