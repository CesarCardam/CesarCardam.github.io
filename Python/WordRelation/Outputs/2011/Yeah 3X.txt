Move your body, out on the floor
Put your troubles aside
Start living anybody can let go
Throw away all your problems
'Cause right now it's party time
Girl don't feel outta place
'Cause I, I'm in love with this feeling now
And I, I, hope that this will last a while
We should make it last a while

Get more bottles, bring 'em to me
Hold your glasses up, people everywhere
