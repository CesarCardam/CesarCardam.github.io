02. LMFAO featuring Lauren Bennett & GoonRockSorry For Party Rocking
Party rock!
Yeah!
Woo!
Let's go
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gonna make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gonna make you lose your mind
We just wanna see ya shake that ass
In the club party rock, lookin' for your girl? She on the top
Nonstop when we in the spot, party movin' like its on the block
Where the dance I gots to know, tight jeans, cool shoes 'cause I'm rock 'n' roll
Half black, half white, domino, game the money, op-a-doe
Yo, I'm runnin' through these streets like Drano
I got that devilish flow, rock 'n' roll, no halo
We party rock, yeah, that's the crew that I'm with
On the rise to the top, no lead in our zeppelin, hey
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gonna make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gonna make you lose your mind
We just wanna see ya shake that
Everyday I'm shufflin'
Shufflin', shufflin'
Step up fast and be the first one to make me blow this cash
We gettin' money, don't be mad now, stop, hating is bad
One more shot for us, another round
Please fill up my cup, don't mess around
We just wanna see you shake it now
Now you wanna be, you're shakin now
Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound
Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound
Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound
Put your hands up to the sound, put your hands up to the sound
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, put your hands up to the sound, to the sound
Put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up
Party rock is in the house tonight
(Put your hands up)
Everybody just have a good time
(Put your hands up)
And we gonna make you lose your mind
(Put your hands up)
Everybody just have a good, good, good time
Put your hands up

Shake that, everyday I'm shufflin'!
