87. Jason DeruloFuture History
Jason Derulo!
Check that out, what they playin'
That's my song, that's my song
Where my drinks?
I've been waiting much too long, much too long
And this girl in my lap, passing out, she's a blonde
The last thing on my mind is goin' home
From the window (from the window)
To the wall (to the wall)
This club is jumpin' (this club is jumpin')
Til tomorrow ('Til tomorrow)
Is it daylight? (Is it daylight?)
Or is it night time? (Is it night time)
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
We gon' tear the club up (up,up,up,up)
Dayo, me say dayo,
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home.
Yeah so, we losin' control,
Turn the lights low 'cause we about to get blown.
Let the club shut down,
(We won't go, oh, oh, oh)
Burn it down,
(To the floor, oh, oh, oh)
Dayo, me say dayo,
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
We drink the whole bottle but it ain't over, over
Everybody jumping on the sofa, sofa
Standing on the chairs,
Standing on the bar,
No matter day or night, I'm shining,
Bitch, I'm a star.
From the window (from the window)
To the wall (to the wall)
This club is jumpin' (this club is jumpin')
Til tomorrow ('Til tomorrow)
Is it daylight? (Is it daylight?)
Or is it night time? (Is it night time)
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
We gon' tear the club up (up,up,up,up)
Dayo, me say dayo,
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home.
Yeah so, we losin' control,
Turn the lights low 'cause we about to get blown.
Let the club shut down,
(We won't go, oh, oh, oh)
Burn it down,
(To the floor, oh, oh, oh)
Dayo, me say dayo,
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
I just met this sexy Haitian girl moving like a dancer,
Told her and her girlfriends, lets sleep in my cabana,
Ask me where the party's at, baby I'm the answer,
Have another drink with me, shorty where your manners?
Take another shot, another, shot, shot, shot, shot
I can make it hot, make it hot, we go rock until the
Dayo, me say dayo,
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home.
Yeah so, we losin' control,
Turn the lights low 'cause we about to get blown.
Let the club shut down,
(We won't go, oh, oh, oh)
Burn it down,
(To the floor, oh, oh, oh)
Dayo, me say dayo,
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
