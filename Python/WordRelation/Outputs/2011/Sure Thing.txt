92. MiguelAll I Want Is You
Love you like a brother,
Treat you like a friend.
Respect you like a lover
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that
You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that
You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that
You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that
If you be the cash,
I'll be the rubber band
You be the match,
I will be a fuse, boom
Painter baby, you could be the muse
I'm the reporter baby, you could be the news
'Cause you're the cigarette and I'm the smoker
We raise a bet, cause you're the joker
Checked off, you are a chalk
And I can be the blackboard
You could be the talk
And I could be the walk
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire baby
Even when it's do or die
We could do it baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing
You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that
You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that
You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that
You could bet that
Never gotta sweat that
Be the lover, I'll be the fighter baby
If I'm the blunt, you could be the lighter babe
Fire it up!
Writer baby, you could be the quote
If I'm the lyric baby, you could be the note, record that
Saint I'm a sinner, prize I'm a winner and it's you
What did I do to deserve that
Paper baby, I'll be the pen
Say that I'm the one, cause you are a ten
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire baby
Even when it's do or die
We could do it baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing
(Now rock with me baby,
Let me hold you in my arms,
Talk with me babe yeah, yeah)
(Now rock with me baby,
Let me hold you in my arms,
Talk with me babe yeah, yeah)
This love between you and I is simple as pie baby
It's such a sure thing (such a sure thing)
Ooh it such a sure thing (such a sure thing)
Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire baby
Even when it's do or die
We could do it baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing
Love you like a brother,
Treat you like a friend.
Respect you like a lover
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
