71. Lady GagaBorn This Way
It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you
You say sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
And you said to me there's
(Something), something, something about this place
(Something), something about lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
(Something), something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah something about baby you and I
It's been two years since I let you go
I couldn't listen to a joke or Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
