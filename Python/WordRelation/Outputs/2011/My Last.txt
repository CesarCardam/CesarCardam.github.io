100. Big Sean featuring Chris BrownFinally Famous
Hands up in the air
I just want the
I just want the baddest bitch in the world
Right here on my lap
And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'mma I'mma hit this night up like it's my last
I'mma I'mma hit this ass up like its my last
Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Okay, now where that alcohol
You ain't even got to ask
Cause I'mma drink it all like, like its my last
She a seven in the face, but a ten in the ass
She even look better by the end of my glass
See I just walked in fresher than the shirts off in this mu'fucka'
Ima need a baddest broad to twirk off in this motherfucka'
I'mma go hard till it hurts off in this motherfucka'
I'mma ball so you gotta work off in this motherfucka'
The work, and I can get you anything you want
I could, I could, I could put you on
See you look like Beyonce so do it like Beyon
Do it like Beyonce and put it on Sean
Grind hard but a got a lot to show for it
Always had drive like I had to chauffeur it
My team's so true we should get a camera crew
To follow us around and make a show for us
And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'mma I'mma hit this night up like it's my last
I'mma I'mma hit this ass up like its my last
Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Now, I'mma fill this glass up like it's my last
I'mma I'mma blow this bag up like its my last
I'mma spend this cash up like it's my last
And I'mma make it last, like it's my last
And I'm gone, can't remember where I am
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am
And they introduce my fan
Now she all up in space
All all up in my face like you remember who I am
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louie Vuitton Sean
Up in Benny Han Han eating all the wontons
Rose rose over a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants now she rocking Sean John
Man I just ended up on everybody guest list
I'm just doing better than what erry'one projected
Knew that I'd be here so if you asked me how I feel
I'mma just tell you, its everything that I expected Bitch
Hands up in the air
(One time for the West side, let me see them hands)
Hands up in the air
(Two times if you love Good Music)
Hands up in the air
(And three times for the baddest chick in the world
Who got her hands up in the air)
Hands up in the air
And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'mma I'mma hit this night up like it's my last
I'mma I'mma hit this ass up like its my last
Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like
Like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Big ass bottles,
Big ice buckets
I work too hard to be ballin' on a budget
Me and my people do it big out in public cause
'Cause if you don't do it big, bitch you ain't doing nothing
And I'mma hit this drink up like it's my last
I'mma I'mma hit this night up like it's my last
I'mma I'mma hit this ass up like its my last (boi)
Swear I'mma, swear I'mma do it like
Like I like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
all all all all, all all all all
Like I like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
