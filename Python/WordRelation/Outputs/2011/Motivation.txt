53. Kelly Rowland featuring Lil WayneHere I Am
Oh lover, don't you dare slow down
Go longer, you can last more rounds
Push harder, you're almost there now
So go lover, make momma proud
And when were done, I don't wanna feel my legs
And when were done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me baby
But you can't stop there, music still playin' in the background
And you're almost there
You can do it, I believe in you baby
So close from here
Baby I'ma be your motivation
Go, go, go, go, motivation
Go, go, go, go
Uh, girl I turn that thing into a rain-forest
Rain on my head, call that brainstorming
Yeah this is deep, oh, but I go deeper
Make you lose yourself, and finders keepers
It go green light, go Weezy go
I like to taste that sugar, that sweet and low
But hold up wait, new position
I put her on my plate then I do the dishes
She my motivation, I'm her transportation
Cause I let her ride, while I drive her crazy
Then I just keep going going, like I'm racing
When I'm done she hold me like a conversation Weezy baby
And when were done, I don't wanna feel my legs
And when were done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me baby
But you can't stop there, music still playin' in the background
And you're almost there
You can do it I believe in you baby
So close from here, baby I'ma be your motivation
Oh lover, when you call my name
No other, can do that the same no
I won't let ya get up out the game no
So go lover, don't it make me rain
And when were done, I don't wanna feel my legs
And when were done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me baby
But you can't stop there, music still playin' in the background
And you're almost there
You can do it I believe in you baby
So close from here baby I'ma be your motivation
