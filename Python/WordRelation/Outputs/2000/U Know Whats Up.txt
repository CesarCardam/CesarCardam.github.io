65. Donell JonesWhere I Wanna Be
Ooh say what say what say what
Ooh girl you know what's up
Ooh say what say what say what
Ooh girl you know what's up
Me and my people be rolling
Trailing on you and your homies
The very first day of summer
All chromed out in a hummer babe
Hit the park and parle
Hope that your off cause you're awake
Cause you and your girls want to ride
Play all day puff on the lye
1 Ooh say what say what, say what
(You know that I like it baby)
Ooh girl you know what's up
(And you know what I need)
Ooh say what, say what, say what
(You know that I'm bout it baby)
Ooh girl you know what's up
(Ooh)
2 - I'm digging you, I'm feeling you
And you know what's up
Said I'm big on you and I'm wanting you
So tell me what's up
We out five and I'm zoning (?)
Running around two in the morning
Looking fly with that sun dress on
I think I feel a bone coming on
Girl you got me wide open
Fiending all day and I'm hoping
So baby don't front
Backseat jeep, you know what I want
Repeat 1
Repeat 2
Oh yeah, whoa
Digging you, you got me big on you
Repeat 1
Repeat 2 till end
