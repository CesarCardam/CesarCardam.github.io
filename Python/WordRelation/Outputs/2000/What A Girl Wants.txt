What a girl wants, what a girl needs,
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free.
What a girl wants, what a girl needs,
Whatever keeps me in your arms.
And I'm thanking you for being there for me.
Like a rock you waited so patiently, while I got it together.
While I figured it out, I only looked but I never touched,
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us,
Holding hands, making plans,
And it's lucky for me, you understand.
What a girl wants, what a girl needs,
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free.
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly,
What a girl wants, what a girl needs,
Whatever keeps me in your arms.
And I'm thanking you for being there for me.
A weaker man might have walked away, but you had faith
Strong enough to move over and understand, while I got it together.
While I figured it out, they say, "If you love something let it go.
If it comes back it's yours, and that's how you know.
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure."
And you're ready and willing to give me more than
What a girl wants, what a girl needs,
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free.
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly,
What a girl wants, what a girl needs,
Whatever keeps me in your arms.
And I'm thanking you for being there for me.
Somebody sensitive and tough;
Somebody there when the going gets rough;
Every night, he'll be giving his love
To just one girl, one girl, one.
Somebody cool but real tender too,
Somebody, baby, just like you
Can keep me hangin' around with the one who always knew.
I'm thankin' you for being there for me.
What a girl wants, what a girl needs,
Whatever makes me happy and sets you free.
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly,
What a girl wants, what a girl needs,
Whatever keeps me in your arms.
And I'm thanking you for being there for me.
