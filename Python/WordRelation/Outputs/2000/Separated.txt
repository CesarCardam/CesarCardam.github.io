63. AvantMy Thoughts
Every time I see you I get a bad vibe
Just thinking of someone else in between your thighs
And you thought you were slick, had tricks up you sleeve
But I'm sick of your stupid ass and I know you're tired of me
That's why I say
When we were together, we never turned our backs on each other
Now that we're separated, we can't stand one another
I don't want to be with you put that on everything I own
I can't believe I stayed around that damn long
If I never see you again I won't be mad at all
Cause I believe that you are my downfall
When we were together, we never turned our backs on each other
Now that we're separated, we can't stand one another
(You did me wrong)
You did me wrong, I thought you were true
You ran out of my life and now, I'm so through with you
I remember when you used to sit there
I would wrap you in my arms and you would say to me
Yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea
(You did me wrong)
You did me wrong, I thought you were true
You ran out of my life and now, I'm so through with you
I remember when you used to sit there
I would wrap you in my arms and you would say to me
Yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea
When we were together, we never turned our backs on each other
Now that we're separated, we can't stand one another
