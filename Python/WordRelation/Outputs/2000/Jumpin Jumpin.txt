Ladies leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends
'Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'
Though he say he got a girl
Yeah it's true you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot
Last weekend you stayed at home alone and lonely
Couldn't find your man
He was chilling with his homies
This weekend you're going out
If he try to to stop you, you're going off
You got your hair done and your nails done too
A new outfit and your Fendi shoes
And when you're
Cool parlayin' at the hottest spot
Tonight you're gonna
Find the fellas rollin' in the Lexus, drops and Hummers
Though he say he got a girl
Yeah it's true you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop

Call your boys 'cause tonight you're not gonna stay at home
Should tell your girl
She ain't coming tonight, you're going solo
Cut her off 'cause she talk some noise, you know you
Got the right to get your party on so get your
Haircut and your car washed too, lookin'
Like a star in your Armani suit, you need to
Look your best 'cause you're turnin' heads tonight you're gonna
Find a sexy chica that's gonna dance all night, if you wanna
Though he say he got a girl
