74. Jo Dee MessinaBurn
Everybody wants an easy ride
On the merry-go-round that we call life
Take your drive on cruise control
Then you wait to find out it's a winding road
I had my dreams in view
When the money ran out and the engine blew
Hung my tears out to dry
Then my dreams fell out of that clear blue sky
And I, I was walkin' the clouds
Feelin' so safe and sound
Then somethin' else knocks me down
Well, Oh, That's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss
And that's the way it is
One fine day you wake up
Completely, hopelessly fallen in love
He's just what you're lookin' for
The only problem is, that the man's not sure
Another guy'll give you everything
The only problem is you don't feel a thing
Well I know from experience
Nothin's ever gonna make perfect sense
Oh, one day you get what you want
But it's not what you think
Then you get what you need
Well, Oh, That's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss
And that's the way it is
Yeah they say your soul is growin'
But sometimes I feel like throwin' somethin'
Well, Oh, That's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
Well, That's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss
And that's the way it is
