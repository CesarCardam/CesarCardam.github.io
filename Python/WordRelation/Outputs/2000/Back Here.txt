Baby set me free
From this misery
I can't take it no more
Since you ran away
Nothing's been the same
Don't know what I'm living for
Here I am so alone
And there's nothing in this world I can do
Until you're back here baby
Miss you want you need you so
Until you're back here baby
There's a feeling inside
I want you to know
You are the one and I can't
Let you go
So I told you lies
Even made you cry
Baby I was so wrong
Girl I promise you
Now my love is true
This is where my heart belongs
'Cause here I am so alone
And there's nothing in this world I can do
Until you're back here baby
Miss you want you need you so
Until you're back here baby
There's a feeling inside
I want you to know
You are the one and I can't
Let you go
And I wonder (wonder)
Are you thinking of me
'Cause I'm thinking of you
And I wonder (wonder)
Are you ever coming back in my life
'Cause here I am so alone
And there's nothing in this world I can do
Until you're back here baby
Miss you want you need you so
Until you're back here baby
There's a feeling inside
I want you to know
You are the one and I can't
Until you're back here baby
