Lips keep telling me you want me
Hold me close all through the night
And I know deep inside you need me
No one else can make it right
Don't you try to hide the secrets
I can see it in your eyes
You said the words without speaking
Now I'm gonna make you mine
Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life
The time of your life
I'll give you the time of your life
Oh baby, yeah
Your eyes of passion make me crazy
Your existence makes me wild
I wanna loosen up your feelings
See what's hiding inside
Just give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life
The time of your life, yeah
Oh, baby
Aye que rico
Me pone loca
Como te mueves
Como me toca
Tu movimiento
Tu sentimiento
Si yo te quiero
Te doy la noche
Toda la noche
Aye, vamos
Give me just one night
Just give me one night, baby
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night
Just one night, oh baby
I'll give you the time of your life
I'll give you the time of your life
Give me just one night
Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche, oh yeah
I'll give you the time of your life
Come on, come on, come on, now baby
Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life
I'll give you the time of your life
The time of your life, yeah, alright
Oh, yeah
