Do you think you're better off alone
Do you think you're better off alone
Do you think you're better off alone
Talk to me, hum

Talk to me, hum
Talk to me
Do you think you're better off alone
Do you think you're better off alone
Do you think you're better off alone
Do you think you're better off alone
Do you think you're better off alone
Do you think you're better off alone
