You never try me
Always stood right by me
Make living lively
Highly spoken of
My only love
The only one, you're my wifey
Make me life complete, sweet
But you know when to flip it street
Freak but only when it comes to me
See that's why you're my wifey
This you should know
Cause you had my mind blown, oh, oh
Full of junk at the club on bump like what
I had to have you babe
Saw you outside, passenger side
Cause I let my best friend drive
You was in line
That's when you caught my eyes girl
You were so beautiful girl
It was so critical girl
You looked so crucial girl
Something about you is everything
You are mine
You're never trying to eat
Always stood right by me
Make living lively
Highly spoken of
My only love
The only one, you're my wifey
Make me life complete, sweet
But you know when to flip it street
Freak but only when it comes to me
See that's why you're my wifey
You know you're sexy too
I like your attitude
I ain't even mad at you
Girl you're still my boo
Either braids or weave
Skirt or jeans you're still my queen
Babygirl go do your thing
I'm so glad you're on my team
You were so beautiful girl
It is so critical girl
You looked so crucial girl
Something about you is everything
You are mine
You're never trying to eat
Always stood right by me
Make living lively
Highly spoken of
My only love
The only one, you're my wifey
Make me life complete, sweet
But you know when to flip it street
Freak but only when it comes to me
See that's why you're my wifey
Someone I can spend my life with
Leave the keys to the Benz
Wedding band with your gems
You're someone I feel all right with
Someone to have my kids
Someone I can depend
You're never trying to eat
Always stood right by me
Make living lively
Highly spoken of
My only love
The only one, you're my wifey
Make me life complete, sweet
But you know when to flip it street
Freak but only when it comes to me
See that's why you're my wifey
Skinny designer fit real jiggy
Ain't afraid to hump with me
When we get busy
Ride out I licky-licky
Till I get dizzy
Toes done, fresh scent
I think it's sizzly
Oh someone who was down with me
used to struggle
now we bubble count the g's with me
Pop the champagne
Let's take a sippy-sippy
Describe you I try to
You're my wifey
Will you be my wifey?
(Yes I'll be your wifey)
Oh say you'll be my wifey girl
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Will you be my wifey?
(Yes I'll be your wifey)
Oh say you'll be my wifey girl
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
