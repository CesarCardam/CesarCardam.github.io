93. LFOLFO
I'm wishing on a falling star...
Wondering where you are...
[Chorus:]
I wished for you on a falling star
Wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind
In the warm sunshine
She's from the city of angels
Like Bette Davis, James Dean and Gable
Never know what she means to me
I fell for the girl that's on TV
Met her at a gala affair
She wore a green dress and everybody was there
Felt outta place as she looked into my eyes
Shook her hand around 9pm and now
I'm never gonna be the same again
Never have to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams
Shoobie-do-wop and scooby snacks
Met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star, oh
My friends, they won't believe me
If they could only see me
At the risk of sounding cheesy
I think I fell for the girl on TV
[Chorus:]
Everybody knows her name
Want to take her picture and they're glad she came
But I just want to be there when she's down, down
(Be there when she's down)
I don't want her autograph
I just want to call her up and make her laugh
Never had to be on the movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams
Shoobie-do-wop and scooby snacks
I met a fly girl and I can't relax
Only problem is she's a movie star
My friends, they won't believe me
If they could only see me
At the risk of sounding cheesy
I think I fell for the girl on TV
[Chorus:]
I wished for you on a falling star
I'm wishing on a star and I'm wondering where you are
Wondering where you are
Do I cross your mind in the warm sunshine
Yeah, so I wished for you on a bright, shining star
Everywhere I look, there you are
It's the girl in the green dress
She took my breath away
And now I look to the sky for the better day
To the beat why'all and scooby snacks
I met a fly girl and I can't relax
Never had to be on the movie screen
'Cause she's the leading lady in all my dreams
[Chorus:]
