Woo
Yea yea
Mm hmmm
Ooh yea
I don't want to be (be without yah be without yah)
I don't want to live (live without yah live without yah)
I don't want to go (go without yah go without yah)
I don't want to be alone
When we hooked up
We sat down
Made and agreement
We vowed that
That we'd always be together
Do whatever
We said that
No one ever get between us
That we'd never ever leave us
That was a while ago
But now lately
It feels like
I mean I feel like
All we do is fight
Every single night
Can't make it tight
Can't get it right
I just want to go back
Take it way back
On the way back
Can we start again
Do it over
Can we straighten it out
Can we work it out
I don't want to be (be without yah be without yah)
I don't want to live (live without yah live without yah)
I don't want to go (go without yah go without yah)
I don't want to be alone
I don't want to be (be without yah be without yah)
I don't want to live (live without yah live without yah)
I don't want to go (go without yah go without yah)
I don't want to be alone
I can't sleep without yeah
Think without yeah
Eat without yeah
Be without yeah
I can't even
Breathe without yeah
I can't feel with out yeah
Deal without yeah
Spend without yeah
My whole world is upside down
Don't want to go out 'cause I can't
Ride without yeah
Feel like I'm gonna
Die without yeah
What is a girl suppose to do
When I spend my last time
With me in your life
I don't want to be without you
I don't want to be (be without yah be without yah)
I don't want to live (live without yah live without yah)
I don't want to go (go without yah go without yah)
I don't want to be alone
I don't want to be (be without yah be without yah)
I don't want to live (live without yah live without yah)
I don't want to go (go without yah go without yah)
I don't want to be alone
