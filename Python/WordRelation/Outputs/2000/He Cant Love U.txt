62. Jagged Edgealbum
I ain't no hata or nothing
But he can't love you like I can
Trust me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
As the clock strikes twelve
I'm sitting here wondering how the hell
Did I let you leave
And baby I know that I did my share
Of things to deceive you
I'm just trying to get an understanding
Of what to do
Cause I'm half way going crazy
Girl they can't fade me
He can't love you like I love you
Baby you know it too
And you should never wanna be with a man
If he can't be a man
And do the things to you like I can
He can't love you like I love you
Baby you know it too
And you should never wanna be with a man
If he can't be a man
And do the things to you like I can
I stop, and I wait, and I think
That I never met someone to make me feel
Like I'm ready to love
So I gotta do what I gotta do
Just to keep you
Keep you here with me baby
Now I feel it's time for me to say
That I need you boo
And I can't go a day without your loving
Baby I can't live without you
I know you know
No matter if you want it baby
Ain't no ifs, or buts, or maybes
And I know that one day you'll see
That he can't really love you like I love you
He can't love you like I love you
Baby you know it too
And you should never wanna be with a man
If he can't be a man
And do the things to you like I can
He can't love you like I love you
Baby you know it too
And you should never wanna be with a man
If he can't be a man
And do the things to you like I can
He can't, he can't love you girl
He's never gonna love you girl
Like I love you girl
He can't, he can't love you girl
He's never gonna love you girl
Like I love you girl
He can't, he can't love you girl
He's never gonna love you girl
Like I love you girl
He can't, he can't love you girl
He can't love you like I love you
Baby you know it too
And you should never wanna be with a man
If he can't be a man
And do the things to you like I can
