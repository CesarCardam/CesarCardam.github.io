52. PinkCan&#039;t Take Me Home
I never cared too much for love
It was all a bunch of mush that I just did not want
Paid was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game
Couldn't be more fly, gettin' paid was everything
But I'm not every girl and I don't need that world to validate me
Cuz shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart
Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love
I was a girl about the floss
It was all about the cost, how much he spent on me
Seek, for a man who's got the means
To be givin' you diamond rings
It's what every fly girl could want or even dream
But I'm not every girl and I don't need no G to take care of me
Cuz shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart, no no
Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love
Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love
But I'm not every girl
And I don't need no G to take care of me, no
'Cause shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart, oh most girls
Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love
Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love
'Cause I'm not most girls, don't wanna dance if he can't be everything
I, I just want real love, said I gotta have real love
Everything that, can you be everything that I dream of
