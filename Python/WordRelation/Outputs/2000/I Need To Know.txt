They say around the way you've asked for me
There's even talk about you wanting me
I must admit that's what I want to hear
But that's just talk until you take me there oh
If it's true don't leave me all alone out here
Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there
Tell me what you're feeling cause I need to know
Girl you've gotta let me know which way to go
Cause I need to know
I need to know
Tell me baby girl cause I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
Tell me baby girl cause I need to know
My every thought is of this being true
It's getting harder not to think of you
Girl I'm exactly where I want to be
The only thing is I need you here with me - oh
If it's true don't leave me all alone out here
Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there
Tell me what you're feeling cause I need to know
Girl you've gotta let me know which way to go
Cause I need to know
I need to know
Tell me baby girl cause I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
Tell me baby girl cause I need to know
Cause I need to know
I need to know
Tell me baby girl cause I need to know
I need to know
I need to know
Tell me baby girl cause I need to know
