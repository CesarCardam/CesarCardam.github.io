This is for my ghetto motherfuckers
Uh hey

See y'all be drivin' those Lexus jeeps, and Benz jeeps and the Lincoln jeeps
Nothin' cheaper wit' the Platinum Visa
Hot boyz
Baby you got what I want
See y'all be drivin' Jaguars, and the Bentley's, and the Rolls Royce
Playin' hardball wit' the Platinum Visa
Is that your car, the skate
Are you ridin' alone, can I be your date
Come get me, get me
Don't dis me, don't trick me

Can you hook 'em up wit' some boyz like you
A hot boy, a rock boy
A top boy, and I like those
Hot boyz
Baby YOU got what I want
See y'all be drivin' those Lexus jeeps, and Benz jeeps and the Lincoln jeeps
Nothin' cheaper wit' the Platinum Visa
Hot boyz
Baby you got what I want
See y'all be drivin' Jaguars, and the Bentley's, and the Rolls Royce
Playin' hardball wit' the Platinum Visa
Yo, I'ma dig in yo pockets
Dig in yo wallets

With a lot boy, and you tote a glock boy
