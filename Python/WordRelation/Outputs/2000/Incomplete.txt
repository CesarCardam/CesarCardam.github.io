Bright Lights, Fancy Restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
I got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now
Pretty Faces from the covers of a magazine
From their covers to my covers want to lay with me
Fame and Fortune still can't find, just a grown man runnin' out of time
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't want to be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars, all the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything, but I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete
Without you girl my life is incomplete
Listen
Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love, I wasn't sure that I was
It's been a year Winter, Summer, Spring and Fall
But being without you just ain't livin' ain't livin'at all
If I could travel back in time, I'd relive the days you were mine
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't want to be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars, all of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything,but I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete
That without you girl
I just can't help lovin' you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything and everything to hear you say, that you'll stay
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't want to be a lonely fool
All of the women, all of the expensive cars, all of the money don't amount to you
(you can have it all) I can make believe I have everything,
but I can't pretend that I don't see (Just give me my baby)
That without you girl my life is incomplete
Even though it seems I have everything
I don't want to be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars, all the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything, but I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete
Without you girl
Without you girl
Without you girl you girl my life is incomplete
Without you girl you girl my life is incomplete
Oh yeah
My life is incomplete
Oh yeah, yeah
