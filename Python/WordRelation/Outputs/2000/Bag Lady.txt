Bag lady you gone hurt your back
Dragging all them bags like that
I guess nobody ever told you
All you must hold onto, is you, is you, is you
One day all them bags gon' get in your way
One day all them bags gon' get in your way
I said one day all them bags gon' get in your way
One day all them bags gon' get in your way, so pack light,
Pack light, mm, pack light, pack light, oh ooh
Bag lady you gon' miss your bus
You can't hurry up, 'cause you got too much stuff
When they see you coming, niggas take off running
From you it's true, oh yes they do
One day he gon' say you crowding my space
One day he gon' say you crowding my space
I said one day he gon' say you crowding my space
One day he gon' say you crowding my space so, pack light
Pack light, mm, pack light, pack light, ooh ooh
