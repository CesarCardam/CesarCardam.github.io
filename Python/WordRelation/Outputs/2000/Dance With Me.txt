Oh come and dance with me, my baby
Lets dance till we go crazy
The night is young and so are we
Let's make love and dance the night away
What I really want to do
Is just dance with you
And feel your body tight
Show ya how to do it right
I can show you every move
I know just what to do
Each step we do is refine
One dance and you'll be mine
So baby when we hit the floor
You'll be asking for more
Let's make love and dance the night away
Oh come and dance with me, my baby
Let's dance, do it, go crazy
The night is young and so are we
Let's make love and dance the night away
Oh put your hand in mine
Promise I'll take my time
We'll dance from head to toe
I can dance fast or slow
Baby look into my eyes
Let the music hypnotize
Let our bodies synchronize
When we're dancing you'll be mine
So baby when we hit the floor
You'll be asking for more
Let's make love and dance the night away
Oh come and dance with me, my baby
Let's dance, do it, go crazy
The night is young and so are we
Let's make love and dance the night away
Oh when it comes to dancing
I know how to move
When it comes to passion
I know just what to do
I feel the music inside
I feel like I am alive
Pretend I was right
Let's make love
Oh come and dance with me, my baby
Let's dance, do it, go crazy
The night is young and so are we
Let's make love and dance the night away
Oh come and dance
Let's dance
The night
Let's make love and dance the night away
Oh come and dance with me, my baby
Let's dance, do it, go crazy
The night is young and so are we
Let's make love and dance the night away
