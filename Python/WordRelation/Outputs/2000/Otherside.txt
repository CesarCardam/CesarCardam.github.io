59. Red Hot Chili PeppersCalifornication
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you've gone you can never go back
I've got to take it on the other side
Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I've got to take it on the other side
Take it on
Take it on
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the other side
Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for a soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread I've got to take it on the other side
Take it on the other side
Take it on
Take it on
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
Turn me on take me for a hard ride
Burn me out leave me on the other side
I yell and tell it that it's not a friend
I tear it down I tear it down
And then it's born again
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
How long I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
