97. Destiny's Child#1&#039;s
Lucy Liu, with my girl, Drew
Cameron D and Destiny
Charlie's Angels, come on
Uh, uh, uh
Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your cell why when I'm feelin' lonely
When it's all over please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own fun, oh, and I pay my own bills
Always 50/50 in relationships
The shoes on my feet, I've bought it
The clothes I'm wearing, I've bought it
The rock I'm rockin', I've bought it
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch you're wearin', I'll buy it
The house I live in, I've bought it
The car I'm driving, I've bought it
I depend on me, I depend on me
All the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollas
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
Tell me how you feel about this
Who would I want if I would wanna live?
I worked hard and sacrificed to get what I get
Ladies, it ain't easy bein' independent
Question, how'd you like this knowledge that I brought
Braggin' on that cash that he gave you is to front
If you're gonna brag, make sure it's your money you flaunt
Depend on no one else to give you what you want
The shoes on my feet, I've bought it
The clothes I'm wearing, I've bought it
The rock I'm rockin', I've bought it
'Cause I depend on me, if I want it
The watch you're wearin', I'll buy it
The house I live in, I've bought it
The car I'm driving, I've bought it
I depend on me, I depend on me
All the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollas
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
Destiny's child, wassup?
You in the house? Sure 'nuff
We'll break these people off Angel style
Child of destiny
Independent beauty
No one else can scare me
Charlie's Angels
Woah, all the women who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys who makin' money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas who profit dollas
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that?
Girl, I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down
