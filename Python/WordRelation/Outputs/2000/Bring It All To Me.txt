30. BlaqueBlaque
featuring N'Sync
[Shamari]
There you are
Looking as fine as can be
In your fancy car
I can see you looking at me
What you want to do?
Are you just gonna sit there and stare?
Baby talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind, baby oh
1 - Oh baby, bring it all to me
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings
Oh baby, bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy
[J.C.]
Baby, what's the deal?
Would I be too forward if
I told you how I feel
That's just the way I do my thang
I'm so for real
Are you feeling my Timb's, my baggy jeans
My thug appeal
Do you like it when a man can keep it real?
Oh
Repeat 1
Oh, baby
[Shamari]
Oh, I'll put my pride to the side
Just to tell you how good you make me feel inside
[J.C.]
There's not a single question
That we can't make this right
Cause it's you I need every day and night
[J.C. & Shamari]
oh ho ho baby yeah
Repeat 1 until fade
