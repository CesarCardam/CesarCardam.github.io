86. KandiHey Kandi
I don't have to question
Where you were last night
Cause I already know what you will say
I already know you'll lie
But I can't be mad at ya
Cause there's something that you don't know
That when your gone I do my own thing
Can I catch a bone? Why you dogging me?
When your out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when your out making love, don't think I'm not
When your feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, cause I'm out getting mine
When your out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when your out making love, don't think I'm not
When your feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, cause I'm out getting mine
When I try to get your attention
You ignore me everytime
You were so caught up doing your dirt
That you didn't notice mine
Well I couldn't put up with your scheming
And I couldn't put up with your lies
They say two wrongs won't make a right
But it suited me just fine
When your out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when your out making love, don't think I'm not
When your feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, cause I'm out getting mine
When your out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when your out making love, don't think I'm not
When your feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, cause I'm out getting mine
Don't be surprised to know that sometimes women play the field
You may not believe it, but it's real
The game is so real, so real, so real
Oh, don't think we won't do it
When your out in the club.
When your out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when your out making love, don't think I'm not
When your feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, cause I'm out getting mine
When your out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when your out making love, don't think I'm not
When your feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, cause I'm out getting mine
When your out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when your out making love, don't think I'm not
When your feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, cause I'm out getting mine
When your out in the club, don't think I'm not
Even when your out making love, don't think I'm not
When your feeling good in somebody's spot, getting hot, don't stop
Just don't think I'm not, cause I'm out getting mine
