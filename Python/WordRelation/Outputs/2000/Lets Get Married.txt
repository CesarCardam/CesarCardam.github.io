46. Jagged EdgeJ.E. Heartbreak
See first of all
I know these so-called playas wouldn't tell you this
But I'ma be real and say what's on my heart
Let's take this chance and make this love feel relevant
Didn't you know I loved you from the start, yeah
When I think about all these years we put in this relationship
Who knew we'd make it this far?
When I think about where we would I be if we were to just fall apart
And I just can't stand the thought of leaving you
Meet me in the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling all the while girl I must confess
Girl let's just get married
I just wanna get married
Meet me in the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling all the while girl I must confess
Let's just get married
Baby lets wanna get married
Said I done it all
But frankly girl I'm tired of this emptiness
I wanna come home to you and only you
'Cause making love to just anyone ain't happening
I just gotta be with you
Do you think about us finishing something we started so long ago?
I wanna give you my all
Do you think about us maybe having some babies?
Come on won't you be my lady forever,yeah
I'm ready to commit to you
And I just can't wait for that night
'Cause I need you here with me
And let's start a family
Meet me in the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling all the while girl I must confess
Girl let's just get married
I just wanna get married
Meet me in the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling all the while girl I must confess
Let's just get married
Meet me in the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling all the while girl I must confess
Girl let's just get married
I just wanna get married
Meet me in the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling all the while girl I must confess
Let's just get married
Meet me in the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling all the while girl I must confess
Girl let's just get married
I just wanna get married
Meet me in the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
Been feeling all the while girl I must confess
Girl let's just get married
