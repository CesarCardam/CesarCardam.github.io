It's been a long time (long time), we shouldn't of left you (left you),
Without a dope beat to step to
It's been a long time (long time) we shouldn't of left you (left you),
Without a dope beat to step to
What would you do, to get to me?
What would you say, to have your way?
Would you give it up or try again?
If I hesitate to let you in?
Now would you be yourself, or play a role?
Tell all the boys, or keep it low?
If I say no, would you turn away,
Or play me off or would you stay oh
If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed),
Dust yourself off, and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed),
You can dust it off, and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
I'm into you, you into me?
But I can't let it go, so easily
Not 'till I see, where this could be
Could be eternally, or just week
You know our chemistry, it's off the chain
It's perfect now, but will it change?
This ain't a yes, this ain't a no
Just do your thang, and we'll see how it goes, ooh
If at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Dust yourself off, and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
See you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be shy on the first day
What about the next day? (Huh, huh, huh, huh)
See you don't wanna throw it all away.
I might be buggin' on the first day
But what about the next day? (Huh, huh, huh, huh)
And if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed),
Dust yourself off, and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
And if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed yeah)
Dust yourself off, and try again (you can)
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again (again, yeah)
Dust yourself off and try again, try again
And if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Dust yourself off, and try again (again)
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed) (baby)
You can dust it off and try again (yeah)
Dust yourself off and try again, try again (again again)
It's been a long time (long time)
Without a dope beat to step to
It's been a long time we shouldn't of left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
And if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Dust yourself off, and try again (again)
You can dust it off and try again, try again
'Cause if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again (yeah)
Dust yourself off and try again, try again, try again
It's been a long time (long time) we shouldn't of left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
It's been a long time we shouldn't of left you (left you)
Without a dope beat to step to
