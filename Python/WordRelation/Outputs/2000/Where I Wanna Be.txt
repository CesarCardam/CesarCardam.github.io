81. Donell JonesWhere I Wanna Be
I said I left my baby girl a message
Saying I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
That I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she give me some time
I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her but I need some time
To be alone
But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad
Now that I want to leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I want to be
Where I want to be
Sweet little do-dee-do-dee
I don't mean to hurt you baby, oh no
Never did I imagine
That you would play a major part
In a decision that's so hard
Do I leave, do I stay, do I go
I think about my life and what matters to me the most
Girl the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone
But I have to find what life is like
Without you
But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad
Now that I want to leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I want to be
Where I want to be
Sweet little do-dee-do-dee
I don't mean to hurt you baby
See when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad
Now that I want to leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I want to be
See when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad
Now that I want to leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I want to be
See when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh how I feel so sad
Now that I want to leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I want to be
Where I want to be
I'm sorry baby
