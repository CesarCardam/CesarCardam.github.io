Yeah baby, I'm coming to get you
You might stop a hurricane
Might even stop the drivin' rain
You might have a dozen other guys
But if you wanna stop me baby, don't even try
I'm goin' one way, your way
It's such a strong way, let's make it our way
Now baby can't stop this thing we started
You gotta know it's right
Can't stop this course we've plotted, yeah
This thing called love we got it
No place for the brokenhearted
I can't stop this thing we started, no way
I'm goin' your way
You might stop the world spinnin' round
Might even walk on holy ground
I ain't Superman and I can't fly
But if you wanna stop me baby, don't even try
I'm goin' one way, your way
It's such a strong way, let's make it our way
Now baby can't stop this thing we started
You gotta know it's right
I can't stop this course we've plotted, yeah
This thing called love we got it
No place for the brokenhearted
I can't stop this thing we started, no way
I'm goin' your way, That's where I'm goin'
Oh, why take it slow
I gotta know
Hey, 'cause nothing can stop this thing that we got
Oh yeah I can't stop this thing we started
Yeah, you gotta know it's right
Can't stop this course we've plotted, oh yeah
This thing called love we got it
Ain't no place for the brokenhearted
I can't stop it
I can't stop it
Can't stop this thing we started
You gotta know it's alright
Can't stop this course we've plotted, oh yeah
Baby
Can't stop it
Can't stop it
I can't stop it yeah yeah, can't stop
