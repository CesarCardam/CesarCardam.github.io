35. Lenny KravitzMama Said
Here we are still together
We are
So much time wasted
Playing games with love
So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But baby it ain't over 'til it's over
So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive
But baby it ain't over 'til it's over
How many times
Did we give up
But we always worked things out
And all my doubts and fear
Kept me wondering
If I'd always, always be in love
So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
But baby it ain't over 'til it's over
So many years we've tried
And kept our love alive
'Cause baby it ain't over 'til it's over
So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
Baby it ain't over 'til it's over
So many years we've tried
And kept our love alive
'Cause baby it ain't over 'til it's over
So many tears I've cried
So much pain inside
Baby it ain't over 'til it's over
So many years we've tried
to keep our love alive
'Cause baby it ain't over 'til it's over
So many tears we've cried
So much pain inside
But baby it ain't over 'til it's over
So many years we've tried
to keep our love alive
'Cause baby it ain't over 'til it's over
So many tears we've cried
So much pain inside
But baby it ain't over 'til it's over, over
