Boyz II Men
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast fling
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft
It's long overdue but now
Philly is slammin'
Boyz II Men, ABC, BBD
The east coast family
Never skipped a beat, na
While cooling on South street
Jet black Benz, plenty of friends
And all the Philly steaks you could eat
Back in school we used to dream about this everyday
Could it really happen?
Or do dreams fade away?
Then we started singing them
They said it sounded smooth
So we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast fling
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft
The spotlight is on us now
Watch us do this
Da da, daaa da da, da da da da da da
Live and direct from Philly town
Rap and hype and we can get down
We are ready to roll
So now the world will know that we were
Back in school we used to dream about this everyday
Could it really happen?
Or do dreams fade away?
Then we started singing them
They said it sounded smooth
So we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast fling
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft
Doom doom doom da da, doom doom doom da da
Da di da di da da, da da, daa daa daa
Doom doom doom da da, doom doom doom da da
Da di da di da da, da da, daa daa daa
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast fling
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft
