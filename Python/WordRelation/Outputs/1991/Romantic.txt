24. Karyn WhiteRitual Of Love
Take me in your arms caress me gently oh I can't get enough
Thrill me say the word I will surrender to your poetic charms
When the night falls I hear seductive voices
sing romantic songs of love let's get intimate
Turn the lights down it's time to get romantic
You and me romantic now.
Light a candle it's time to get romantic
the night has just begun oh baby we're gonna make it
Kiss me I feel waves of steamy passion I'm burning with desire
Free me from the heat my heart's on fire 'cause
I still need your love under the moonlight with stars shining so bright
baby my mind is on love when we get home tonight
Turn the lights down it's time to get romantic
You and me romantic now.
Light a candle it's time to get romantic
