14. Damn Yankeesalbum
I don't want to hear about it anymore,
It's a shame I've got to live without you anymore.
There's a fire in my heart,
A pounding in my brain, it's driving me crazy.
We don't need to talk about it anymore.
Yesterday's just a memory; can we close the door?
I just made one mistake,
I didn't know what to say when you called me baby.
Don't say goodnight,
Say you're gonna stay forever,
Oh, whoa, all the way.
Can you take me high enough
to fly me over yesterday?
Can you take me high enough?
It's never over and yesterday's just a memory,
Yesterday's just a memory.
And I don't want to live without you anymore.
Can't you see I'm in misery?
And you know for sure
I would live and die for you
And I'd know just what to do when you call me baby.
Don't say goodbye
Say you're gonna stay forever,
Oh, whoa, all the way.
Can you take me high enough
Can you fly me over yesterday?
Can you take me high enough?
It's never over and yesterday's just a memory.
I was running
I was running for the door
The next thing I remember
I was running back for more
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't say goodbye
Say you're gonna stay forever,
Oh, whoa, all the way, all the way,
Come all the way, yeah.
Can you take me high enough
Can you fly me over yesterday?
Can you take me high enough?
It's never over, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can you take me high enough
Won't you fly me over yesterday?
Can you take me high enough?
It's never over, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
