88. Black BoxDreamland
Strike it up, strike it up, strike it up
Strike it up, strike it up, strike it up
You-ooh, you-ooh
You-ooh, you-ooh
Strike it up, this band is gonna play my tune
Strike it up, I want to, I want to tell you so
Strike it up, nobody's gonna stop my sound
Strike it up, you know how lonely one can feel
If I have the line and you have the bass
Then strike it up and you'll find the rhythm's on time
Line after line going straight to your mind
'cause hyping the place is what we're all about
Moving your waist to the bass is no doubt
Roll up the groove, melody is essential
Drop the knowledge on this instrumental
Cast your doubts about house music
You've got the body, so why don't you use it?
Naturally swinging your thing to the song
'cause that's how we pump the dancefloor for the strong
Waiting on my feelings, yeah-heah
Waiting on my feelings, feelings
Waiting on my feelings, yeah-heah
Waiting on my feelings, feelings
Strike it up, your hand is tapping on my skin
Strike it up, and keep me, and keep me standing on
Strike it up, you nobody's gonna let you down
Strike it up, you know how lovely one can be
If I have the line and you have the bass
Then strike it up and you'll find the rhythm's on time
Line after line going straight to your mind
'cause hyping the place is what we're all about
Moving your waist to the bass is no doubt
Roll up the groove, melody is essential
Drop the knowledge on this instrumental
Cast (Dance?) your doubts about house music
You've got the body, so why don't you use it?
Naturally swinging your thing to the song
'cause that's how we pump the dancefloor for the strong
Waiting on my feelings, yeah-heah
Waiting on my feelings, feelings
Waiting on my feelings, yeah-heah
Waiting on my feelings, feelings
Waiting on my feelings, yeah-heah
Waiting on my feelings, feelings
Waiting on my feelings, yeah-heah
Waiting on my feelings, feelings
Strike it up...
