I think I know what you mean and
Although it sounds obscene
I will always do my best to understand
You have so many words and
Your voice is always heard but
Who can say they really understand
Real, real, real
Do you feel real and if so I'd like to know
How to feel real, real
Do you feel real and if so I'd like to know
You say you have a big love and
It really sounds like fun
If I knew what it was then I'm sure I'd like to have one
Give me a sign that you feel some emotion
Real, real, real
Do you feel real and if so I'd like to know
How to feel real, real
Do you feel real and if so I'd like to know
If there's nothing to say then
Why don't we all go away?
Real, real, real
Do you feel real and if so I'd like to know
How to feel real, real
Do you feel real and if so I'd like to know
If there's nothing to say then
Why don't we all go away?
Real, real, real
Do you feel real and if so I'd like to know
How to feel real, real
Do you feel real and if so I'd like to know
