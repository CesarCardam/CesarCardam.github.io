Eagle's calling and he's calling your name.
Tides are turning bringing winds of change.
Why do I feel this way?
The promise of a new day.
The promise, the promise of a new day.
As thru time the earth moves under my feet.
One step closer to make love complete.
What has the final say?
The promise of a new day.
The promise, the promise of a new day.
The promise, the promise of a new day.
The promise, the promise of a new day.
The promise.
And so time over time what will change the world,
no one knows. (no one knows.)
So the only promise is a day to live,
to give and share with one another.
See the wisdom from mistakes in our past.
Hear the younger generation ask,
"Why do I feel this way?"
The promise, of a new day
The promise, the promise of a new day.
