44. RoxetteA Collection of Roxette Hits: Their 20 Greatest Songs
In a time, where the sun desends alone
I ran a long long way from home
To find a heart that's made of stone
I will try, I just need a little time
To get your face right out of my mind
To see the world through different eyes
Everytime I see you oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Everytime you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower
Tell me why, when I scream there's no reply
When I reach out there's nothing to find
When I sleep I break down and cry
Everytime I see you oh I try to hide away
But when we meet it seems I can't let go
Everytime you leave the room I feel I'm fading like a flower
