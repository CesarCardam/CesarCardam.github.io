86. Aaron NevilleThe Very Best of Aaron Neville
Ok, so your heart is broken
You're sitting around mopin',
Mopin', mopin', cryin', cryin'
You say you're even thinking about dying
Well, before you do anything rash,
Baby, listen to this
Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel,
I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool
Fallin' in love is such an easy thing to do
But there's no guarantee that
The one you love, is gonna love you
Oh, loving eyes they cannot see
A certain person could never be
Love runs deeper than any ocean,
It clouds you're mind with emotion
Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel,
I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool
How can you help it,
When the music starts to play
And your ability to reason, is swept away
Oh, heaven on earth is all you see,
You're out of touch with reality
And now you cry, but when you do,
Next time around someone cries for you
Hey, everybody plays the fool, sometime
Use your heart just like a tool, listen baby
They never tell you so in school,
I want to say it again,
Everybody plays the fool
Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel,
I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool
Every plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel,
I want to say it again
Everybody plays the fool
