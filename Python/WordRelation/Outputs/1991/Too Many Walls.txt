74. Cathy Dennisalbum
Wish on a rainbow is all I can do.
Dream of the good times that we never knew.
No late nights alone in your arms.
I'll dream on. Living in wonder, thinking of you.
Still looking for ways to uncover the truth.
You're so young is all they can say.
They don't know,
If I could change the way of the world I'd be your girl.
Too many walls have been built in between us.
Too many dreams have been shattered around us.
If I seem to give up they'd still never win.
Deep in my heart I know the strength is within.
Watching the others chances drift by.
They'll never discover these feelings I hide.
Deep inside I'm falling apart.
All alone with a broken heart.
Thinking in silence is all they allow.
These words still unspoken may never be found.
All these dreams one day will be mine.
They cross my mind.
My time has yet to come. Until then.
Deep in my heart I know the strength is within.
Too many walls have been built in between us.
Too many dreams have been shattered around us.
If I seem to give up they'd still never win.
Deep in my heart I know the strength is within.
Too many walls have been built in between us.
Too many dreams have been shattered around us.
If I seem to give up they'd still never win.
Deep in my heart I know the strength is within.
Too many walls have been built in between us.
Too many dreams have been shattered around us.
If I seem to give up they'd still never win.
Deep in my heart I know the strength is within.
