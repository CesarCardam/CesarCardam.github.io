You know I won't forget
The times we shared together holding hands
And walking in the park
Sometimes we'll have to do it all again
We were so happy then
I have no regrets
Can't you tell from the look on my face
That I love you more today
The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes
Wiped the tears away the first time
When we fell in love
Although some time has passed
I still remember just like it was yesterday
But time is movin' fast
The love I had for you time won't ever change
I'll always feel the same
Now until the end
Memories we share will live forever
Deep inside my heart I know I'll never forget
The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes
Wiped the tears away the first time
When we fell in love
The first time I looked into your eyes I cried
Do you remember the first time we fell in love
You looked into my eyes
Wiped the tears away the first time
When we fell in love
Oh, when we fell in love
