Look into my eyes,
You will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart,
Search your soul
And when you find me there, you'll search no more
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do,
I do it for you
Look into your heart,
You will find
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am,
Take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice
Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more
You know it's true
Everything I do,
I do it for you
There's no love
Like your love
And no other
Could give more love
There's nowhere
Unless you're there
All the time,
All the way, yeah
Look into your heart, baby
Oh your can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it there's nothin' I want more
Yeah, I would fight for you,
I lie for you
Walk the wire for you, yeah, I'd die for you
You know it's true
Everything I do,
Oh
I do it for you
Everything I do, darling
And we'll see it through
Oh we'll see it through
Oh yeah
Yeah!
Look into your heart
You can't tell me it ain't worth dying for
Oh yeah
I'll be there, yeah
I'll walk the wire for you
I will die for you
Oh yeah
I would die for you
I'm going all the way, all they way, yeah
