64. LL Cool JMama Said Knock You Out
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with her switch and talk with street slang
I love when I woman ain't afraid to do her thang
Standin' at the bus stop, suckin' on a lollipop
When she gets pumpin', it's hard to make the hotty stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She's sweet as brown sugar with candied yams
Honey-coated complexion
Music camay
Let's hear it for the girl
She's from around the way
I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the one)
I need that around the way girl
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'
Silky, bilky
Your smiles' like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you, then another brother would
You're sweet like sugar with your gangsta talk
Wanna eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk, or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as your in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender, act tender
Be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Go flip when you think your man is playing
No cheap or petty
You're ready for loving
You're real independent, so your parents be buggin'
But if you ever need a place to stay
Come around my way
I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one)
I need that around the way girl
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'
Perm in your hair, or even a curly weave
With your New Edition/Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here
You say meet me half way
'Cause brothers been poppin' that yang all day
Around the way, you're like neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat ya, so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While your watchin' all the brothers on the basketball court
Goin' to the movies with your homegirl's crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawkin' you
Baby hair pumpin', lip gloss a-shinin'
I think you're in the mood for whinin' and dinin'
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
I love you, you're from around the way
I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's all I ever need)
I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
Fine as can be (She's all I ever need)
I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
That's the one for me (She's the only one)
I need that around the way girl (Around the way girl)
Fine as can be
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up all your lovin'
Ya gotta shook up, shook down, shook up
