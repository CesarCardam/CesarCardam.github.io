18. Color Me Baddalbum
Dream on, dream away
I think I'm gonna have to stay
Stay forever
I adore mi amor
I adore mi amor
You want to take her place
You say you'd treat me better
But, better I know for sure
You see she loves me
And I could never leave her
Never baby, never
Chica tu eres mi vida la ternura
Y alegría, amor
Y este sueño
Contigo será verdad (yeah yeah)
Dream on, dream away
I think I'm gonna have to stay
Stay forever
I adore mi amor
I adore mi amor
Listen my love, the girl of my dreams
And I will never leave
She's all that I need and more
I'll love her always
What more could a man ask for
What more could I ask for
You know that I really love my baby
She can give me everything I need
There is no one to take her place
She's got my heart in her hands
Baby, I adore
Dream on, dream away
I think I'm gonna have to stay
Stay forever
I adore mi amor
I adore mi amor
Ooh mi amor es por ti que yo vivo y por ti suspiro
No solo hoy, solo hoy si no siempre
Tu estrella brilla siempre en mi
Y este sueño contigo sera realidad te quiero mucho
Baby te quiero mucho, mi amor
You know I love you (I adore)
You know I need you girl (mi amor)
You know that I really love my baby (I adore)
She can give me everything I need (mi amor)
And there would never be noone that could take her place (I adore)
She got my heart in her hands (mi amor)
You're the one that I adore (I adore)
I'll be forever your love (mi amor)
You're the one that I wanna see (I adore)
I want you to stay with me yeah (mi amor
