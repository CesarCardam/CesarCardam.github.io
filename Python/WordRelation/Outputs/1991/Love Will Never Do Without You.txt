Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love
They all said we'd never last
Still we manage to stay together
There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow
They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
'Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you
Other guys have tried before
To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt
Boy it's you I can't do without
I feel better when I have you near me
'Cause no other love around
Has quite the same ooh ooh (ha ha ha!)
Like you do do do do babe
They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
'Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you
Do without you
Love will never do without you
Do without you
Love will never do, never do without you
Love will never do, never do without you
Love will never do, never do without you
Love will never do, never do without you
Never never do
Never never do without you
What
They said it, they said it wouldn't last
They said it, they said it wouldn't last
They said it, they said it wouldn't last
They said it, if you believe in love, say
Love will never do, love will never do without you
They said it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
'Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you
