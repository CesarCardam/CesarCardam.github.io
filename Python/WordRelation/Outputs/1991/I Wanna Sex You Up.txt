02. Color Me Baddalbum
Come inside take off your coat I'll make you feel at home
Now let's pour a glass of wine cause now we're all alone
I've been waiting for you girl just let me hold you close to me
Cause I've been dying for you girl to make love to me
Girl you make me feel real good
We can do it til we both wake up
Girl you know I'm hooked on you
And this is what I'll do
I wanna sex you
All night
You make me feel good
I wanna rub you down
I wanna sex you up
Let me take off all your clothes
Disconnect the phone so nobody knows
Let me light a candle
So we can make it better
Makin' love until we drown
Girl you know it feels real good
We can do it til we both wake up
Girl you know I'm hooked on you
And this is what I'll do
I wanna sex you up
Makin' love until we drown
I wanna sex you up
All I wanna do is
I wanna sex you up
All night
Girl you make me feel good
I wanna rub you down
I wanna sex you up
Make sweet lovin' all night long
I wanna sex you up
Feels so right it can't be wrong
Don't be shy girl rescue me
I wanna sex you up
Open up your heart and I'll set you free
