Listen baby don't even waste your tears on an insensitive man
There's a better place for you
I mean what you really need is someone who cares
Someone who's gonna be there for you, someone like me
Someone with sensitivity
Girl, I know it's been hard since he went away
And left you so sad you cry everyday
Let me kiss your tears erase all your doubts
Because for you I'm here, you won't be without love
Don't need a man that'll give you money
Come on let me show you just what you need honey (I got what you need)
You don't need a man that'll treat you wrong
You need a man with sensitivity (a man like me)
Someone who can love you
Someone who will need you
Someone who will treat you right (like me girl)
Someone who will hold at night
Someone stable in your life (ah baby)
You need a man with sensitivity
A man like me (baby)(honey)
Baby and I'm the man (ah you no, you no)
Baby like i do baby (hang in their baby)
You need a man with sensitivity
A man like me
See you need someone who's there like a gentleman
If anybody can fit the description baby I can
Someone who cares and dares to give himself completely
You got it in me you need a man with sensitivity
You need a man, not any man
Warm and sensitive that's what I can give
You need a man, not any man
Warm and sensitive that's what I can give
You need a man, not any man
Warm and sensitive that's what I can give
Man with sensitivity
A man like me
Don't need a man that'll give you money
Come on let me show you just what you need honey (I got what you need)
You don't need a man that'll treat you wrong
You need a man with sensitivity (a man like me)
Save a little love for me (sensitivity)
Baby I got what you need (I got it)
Man with sensitivity
A man like me
Hold on my darling
Don't let me down
