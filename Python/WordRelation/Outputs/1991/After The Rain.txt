Look in the mirror by now you should know
You're livin in a fantasy and you can't let go
He never really loved you from the start
The only thing he ever gave you was a broken heart
Don't be afraid to lose what was never meant to be
Whoa!
After the rain washes away the tears
All the pain only after the rain
(Can) you live again
I know the emptiness you feel inside
You think if you break away, you'll never survive
I'm waiting as my heart beats just for you
Come on and take my hand and I'll pull you through
But things will never change until you want them to
Whoa!
After the rain washes away the tears
All the pain only after the rain
(Can) you live again
Whoa! Whoa!
After the rain you'll see the sun appear to light the way
Only after the rain, can you hope to find true love again
He never really loved you from the start
The only thing he ever gave you was a broken heart
Come on and take my hand and I'll pull you through
You know the time has come for you to face the truth
After the rain washes away the tears
All the pain only after the rain
(Can) you live again
Whoa! Whoa!
After the rain you'll see the sun appear to light the way
Only after the rain, can you hope to find true love again
After the rain
Whoa, whoa
After the rain you'll love again, a, again
After the rain washes away the tears and all the pain
Oh, after the rain you'll love again
Whoa ah
