17. Jesus JonesDoubt
A woman on the radio talked about revolution
When it's already passed her by
Bob Dylan didn't have this to sing about you
You know it feels good to be alive
I was alive and i waited, waited
I was alive and i waited for this
Right here, right now
There is no other place i want to be
Right here, right now
Watching the world wake up from history
I saw the decade in, when it seemed
The world could change at the blink of an eye
And if anything
Then there's your sign, of the times
I was alive and i waited, waited
I was alive and i waited for this
Right here, right now
I was alive and i waited, waited
I was alive and i waited for this
Right here, right now
There is no other place i want to be
Right here, right now
Watching the world wake up from history
Right here, right now
There is no other place i want to be
Right here, right now
Watching the world wake up from history
Right here, right now
There is no other place i want to be
Right here, right now
Watching the world wake up
