Well, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me.
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good,
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.
We were out on a date in my daddy's car.
We hadn't driven very far.
There in the road, straight ahead ...
The car was stalled, the engine was dead.
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right.
Never forget the sound that night ...
The cryin' tires, the bustin' glass.
The painful scream that I heard last.
Well, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me.
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good,
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.
Well, when I woke up, the rain was pourin' down.
There were people standing all around.
Something warm running in my eyes,
But I found my baby somehow that night.
I raised her head, and when she smiled, and said,
"Hold me darling for a little while."
I held her close. I kissed her our last kiss.
I found the love that I knew I would miss.
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight.
I lost my love ... my life, that night.
Well, where oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me.
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good,
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.
