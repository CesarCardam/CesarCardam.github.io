65. Rick Nelsonalbum
I will gather stars out of the blue
For you, yes baby for you
I'll make a string of pearls out of the dew
For you, yes baby for you
Over the highway and over the street
Carpets of clover I'll lay at your feet
Oh well it's nothing in this world
I wouldn't do, for you, yes baby for you
Over the highway and over the street
Carpets of clover I'll lay at your feet
Oh well it's nothing in this world
I wouldn't do, for you, yes baby for you
I wouldn't do, yes baby for you
Oh I wouldn't do, yes baby for you
Oh I wouldn't do, yes baby for you
