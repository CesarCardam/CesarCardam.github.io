73. Roy OrbisonThe Last Concert
Your baby doesn't love you any more
Golden days before they end
Whisper secrets to the wind
Your baby won't be near you any more
Tender nights before they fly
Send falling stars that seem to cry
Your baby doesn't want you any more
It's over
It breaks your heart in two, to know she's been untrue
But oh what will you do?
When she says to you
There's someone new we're through, we're through
It's over, it's over, it's over
All the rainbows in the sky start to even say goodbye
You won't be seeing rainbows any more
Setting suns before they fall, echo to you that's all that's all
But you'll see lonely sunset after all
