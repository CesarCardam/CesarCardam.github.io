83. Roger Milleralbum
Well, here I sit high, gettin' ideas
Ain't nothing but a fool would live like this
Out all night and runnin' wild
Woman sittin' home with a month-old child
Dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?
Just sittin' around drinkin' with the rest of the guys
Six rounds bought, and I bought five
And I spent the groceries and half the rent
Like fourteen dollars and twenty-seven cents
Dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?
Roses are red and violets are purple
Sugar is sweet and so is maple surple
Well I'm the seventh out of seven sons
My pappy's a pistol, I'm a son-of-a-gun
Well, dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?
