Don't throw your love away
No, no, no, no
Don't throw your love away
For you might need it someday
Don't throw your dreams away
No, no, no, no
Keep them another day
For you might need them someday
Lovers of today
Just throw their dreams away
And play at love
They give their love away
To anyone who'll say, I love you
Don't throw your love away
No, no, no, no
Don't throw your love away
For you might need it someday
Lovers of today
Just throw their dreams away
And play at love
They give their love away
To anyone who'll say, I love you
Go out and have your fun
You better
Have your fun with anyone
But don't throw your love away
Don't throw your love away
No, no, no, no
Don't throw your love away
For you might need it someday
Don't throw your love away
No, no, no, no
Don't throw your love away, yay
