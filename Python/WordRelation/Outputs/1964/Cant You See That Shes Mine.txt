Oh, can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And yet they try so very hard to pull us apart
But we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep on lovin' this way
Cause if they break us up
You know it'll only break my heart
And don't you know I love her so
And I'll never, never, never let her go
No matter what the people may say or try to do
Cause can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she loves me too
People talk and try to break us up
When they know they don't understand
But I don't care what the people may say
I'm gonna keep on holdin' her hand
Can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And yet they try so very hard to pull us apart
But we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep on lovin' this way
Cause if they break us up
You know it'll only break my heart
Don't you know I love her so
And I'll never, never, never let her go
No matter what the people may say or try to do
Cause can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she loves me too
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she'll love me too
