Baby, I need your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Although you're never near
Your voice I often hear
Another day, 'nother night
I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby I need your lovin'
Got to have all you lovin'
Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means having you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losing sleep
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby I need your lovin'
Got to have all you lovin'
Lonely nights echo your name
Oh, sometimes I wonder
Will I ever be the same?
Oh yeah! When you see me smiling
You know things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see has all been rehearsed
Darling, I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside, darling
Makes me feel half alive
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby I need your lovin'
Got to have all you lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
