It hurts to be in love, when the only one you love
turns out to be someone who's not in love with you.
It hurts to love her so
when deep down inside you know,
she will never love you, no matter what you do.
And so you cry a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Oh you die a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Day and night, night and day
It hurts to be in love this way.
How long can I exist?
Wanting lips I've never kissed
She gives all her kisses to somebody else.
She thinks I'm just a friend
now it hurts, I must pretend
The only way to keep her, is to keep it to myself.
And so I cry a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Oh I die a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Day and night, night and day
It hurts to be in love this way.
Yes I cry a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Oh I die a little bit (hurts to be in love)
Day and night, night and day
It hurts to be in love this way.
It hurts to be in love, day and night, night and day
it hurts to be in love. night and day, day and night
it hurts to be in love, day and night, night and day......
