35. Dusty SpringfieldGoing Back
Wishing and hoping and thinking and praying
Planning and dreaming each night of his charms
That won't get you into his arms
So if you're looking to find love you can share
All you got to do is
Hold him and kiss him and love him
And show him that you care
Show him that you care just for him
Do the things he likes to do
Wear your hair just for him, cause
You won't get him
Thinking and a-praying
Wishing and hoping
Just wishing and hoping and thinking and praying
Planning and dreaming his kiss is the start
That won't get you into his heart
So if you're thinking how great true love is
All you got to do is
Hold him and kiss him and squeeze him and love him
Yeah, just do it and after you do, you will be his
(You got to)
Show him that you care just for him
Do the things he likes to do
Wear your hair just for him, cause
You won't get him
Thinking and a-praying
Wishing and hoping
Just wishing and hoping and thinking and praying
Planning and dreaming his kiss is the start
That won't get you into his heart
So if you're thinking how great true love is
All you got to do is
Hold him and kiss him and squeeze him and love him
Yeah, just do it and after you do, you will be his
You will be his, you will be his
