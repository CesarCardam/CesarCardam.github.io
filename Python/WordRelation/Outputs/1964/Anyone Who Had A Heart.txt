71. Dionne WarwickSings Burt Bacharach
Anyone who ever loved could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed could look at me
And know I dream of you
Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and love me, too
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
What am I to do
Every time you go away, I always say
This time it's goodbye, dear
Loving you the way I do
I take you back, without you I'd die dear
Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and love me, too
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
What am I to do
Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and love me, too
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me
Like you hurt me and be so untrue
Anyone who had a heart would love me too
Anyone who had a heart would take me
In his arms and always love me too
Why won't you
Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too, yeah
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in his arms and always love me
Why won't you, yes
Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too
