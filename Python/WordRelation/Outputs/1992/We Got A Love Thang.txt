97. CeCe Penistonalbum
Can't stand it when you're away
Without a doubt,
You're the best thing that's happened to me
Yeah baby, and I just can't wait
To have you by my side
You know whenever you're around
A smile is all that you're gonna see
Cause you make me feel so good inside
And there is no doubt, yeah I'm satisfied
BRIDGE:
I know that I won't find a better love
I got a love that other girls dream of
CHORUS:
We got a love thang
Feels so good to me
This is our thang
That's how a love should be
We got a, we got a love
We got a, we got a love
We got a, that's how a love should be
I used to be lonely
Cause I couldn't find someone
That I could call my own
Oh no, suddenly you stepped in my life
Now you're here with me and
All my lonely days are gone
I don't know if it's wrong or right
But it's better than a lonely night
