55. GenesisWe Can&#039;t Dance
Hot sun beating down
Burning my feet just walking around.
Hot sun making me sweat
'Gators getting close, hasn't got me yet
I can't dance, I can't talk.
The only thing about me is the way I walk.
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything.
Blue jeans sitting on the beach,
Her dog's talking to me, but she's out of reach.
She's got a body under that shirt,
But all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt.
Cause, I can't dance, I can't talk.
The only thing about me is the way I walk.
No, I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling.
And checking everything is in place,
You never know who's looking on.
Young punk spilling beer on my shoes,
Fat guy's talking to me trying to steal my blues.
Thick smoke, see her smiling through.
I never thought so much could happen just shooting pool.
But I can't dance, I can't talk.
The only thing about me is the way I walk.
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling
And checking everything is in place
You never know who's looking on
A perfect body with a perfect face
