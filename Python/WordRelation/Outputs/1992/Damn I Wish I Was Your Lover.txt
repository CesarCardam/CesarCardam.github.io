34. Sophie B. Hawkinsalbum
That old dog has chained you up alright
Give you everything you need
To live inside a twisted cage
Sleep beside an empty rage
I had a dream, I was your hero
Damn, I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smilin' and warm
I am everything, tonight I'll be your mother
I will do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed, oh, oh
Open up on the inside, gonna fill you up, gonna make you cry
This monkey can't stand to see you black and blue
Give you somethin' sweet each time
You come inside my jungle book
What is it just too good?
Don't say you'll stay 'cause then you go away
Damn, I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smilin' and warm
I am everything, tonight I'll be your mother
I will do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks, for me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it
Damn, I wish I was your lover
If I was your girl believe me
I'd turn on the Rollin' Stones
We could groove along and feel much better
Let me in
I could do it forever and ever and ever and ever
Give me an hour to kiss you
Walk through Heaven's door I'm sure
We don't need no doctor to feel much better
Let me in
Forever and ever and ever and ever
I sat on a mountainside with peace of mind
And I lay by the ocean
Makin' love to her with visions clear
Walked the days with no one near
And I return as chained and bound to you
Damn, I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smilin' and warm
I am everything, tonight I'll be your mother
I will do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks, for me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine, I'll grow out of it
Damn, I wish I was your lover
Just open up I'm gonna come inside
I wanna fill you up I wanna make you cry
(Damn I wish I was your lover)
Gettin' on the subway and I'm comin' uptown
(Damn I wish I was your lover)
Standin' on a street corner waitin' for my love to change
(Damn I wish I was your lover)
Feelin' like a school boy, too shy and too young
(Damn I wish I was your lover)
Open up I wanna come inside, I wanna fill you up, I wanna make you cry
(Damn I wish I was your lover)
Gettin' on my camel and I'll ride it uptown, ooh
(Damn I wish I was your lover)
Hanging around this jungle, wishing that this
