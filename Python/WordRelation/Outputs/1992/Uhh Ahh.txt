Mic
The love I have right next to me
Is here and always will be
I'm caressing your body emotionally
As you can feel and will see
Why can't we go all the way to the top
The fullest extreme
The sounds are here when you're with me
Express the way that you feel
And you say
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
In a passionate set we're moving close
The love that we share is the same
I can tell when I reach down deep inside
You show it when you call out my name
Squeezing you tight and holding you close
Is all I feel inside
Although I try to hold in my love
It's something that I just can't hide
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
The music is low
The lights are dim, there we lie
Passion overflows
With every look in your eyes
Infatuation, lust and a lot of love
Sweet caresses and kisses to me as you rub
I clench my back
Ecstasy fills the air
As you kiss on my neck
And stroke the back of my hair
To hold you tonight
I feel this is my duty
To grasp, to hold, to rock that booty
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Give it to me baby
I rub your back as you lay here with me
I want you and I need you
Hold on to me
Right now, baby
Don't go away
Please baby stay with me
Oh I can do it to you in a way nobody else can
