01. Boyz II MenLegacy: Greatest Hits Collection
Girl you know we belong together
I don't have no time for you to be playing with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever baby
You just wait
We belong together
And you know that I am right
Why do you play with my heart?
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me and never
Say goodbye?
When I can't sleep at night
Without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try I just break down and cry
Pain in my head
Oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinning around and around
Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only
Your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together forever
You and I
Will you love me again
Like you loved me before
This time I want you to love me much more
This time instead
Just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me go
Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Girl, I'm here for you
All those times at night
When you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby I knew about it
I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love
Do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not about to go out on cheat you
(Maybe I'll forgive you)
Just like you did baby
But that's alright
I love you anyway
(Maybe you will try)
And I'm still going to be here for you until my dying day
(We should be happy together forever)
Right now
I'm just in so much pain baby
'Cause you just won't come back to me (You and I)
Will you?
Just come back to me
(Lonely)
Yes baby, my heart is lonely (Lonely)
My heart hurts baby (Lonely)
Yes, I feel pain too
Baby please
This time instead just come to my bed
And baby just don't let me go
Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
Although we've come
To the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural
You belong to me
I belong to you
