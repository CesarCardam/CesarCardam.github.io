33. Bobby Brownalbum
Humpin' Around
Bobby Brown
When you trust someone
and you know you're on their back
You ain't got no trusting about you
And you claim that you
Don't care what where I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you
Say you trust someone
Why are you calling all around
Think I've got some dip on the side
Girl you don't trust no one
And you're constantly in doubt
You lose the game, if you play that way
[CHORUS:]
Get up off my back
Save a heart attack
Ain't nobody Humpin' Around (Ain't nobody humpin around)
No matter what they say
No it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin around
Nobody x5
Humpin' around babe
When you love someone
And you want to love them right
Got to get more lovin' about you
And you know that you're holding on too tight
Soon they will be leaving without you
Say that you love someone
Why are you calling all my friends
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl you don't love no one
You don't know what love's all about
You lose the game, (if you) if you play that way
[CHROUS]
Nobody x7
Humpin' around babe
Girl if you trust someone
You don't call on everybody
Ain't nobody foolin' around
And the more I think about it
You lose all your clout and
You lose the game, baby, if you play that way
[CHORUS]
Girl you said you love me
And you said you trust me
Why do you think I'm foolin' around
I can't stand the pressure
You know I'm yours forever
Ain't nobody, nobody, humpin' around
[CHORUS x2]
