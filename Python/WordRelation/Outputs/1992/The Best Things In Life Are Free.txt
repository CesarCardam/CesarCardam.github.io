41. Luther Vandross & Janet Jacksonalbum
Boy, when you look at me, boy
Do you judge me by my cover?
Ya got to be kiddin' me
To think that I'm that kind of lover
I don't mean to disagree
Sorry you can't buy my kisses
Open your heart and see
True love comes for free
I'm keepin' my heart open
Hopin' you won't stab me in it
'Cause I've been in love before
And when I had to pay, I didn't
I'll lose my sanity
Tryin' to measure your intentions
What do you want from me
How much will it be?
No more than you're willing to give
'Cause you won't pay nothin'
For this good lovin'
It's for free
And I won't make you promises
I'll just do all that I can
To be your lover
'Cause I understand
The best things in life are free
Now that I've discovered
What you mean to me
The best things in life are free
Now that we've got each other
The best things in life are free
I know you are my baby
My one and only baby
You said it twice, I'll say it thrice
My baby, baby, baby
I got so much love for you
And it's easy to give it
When I know you feel
The same way too
That's all I expect from you
Just do all that you can to be my lover
'Cause I understand
(I do)
The best things in life are free
Now that I've discovered
What you mean to me
The best things in life are free
Now that we've got each other
The best things in life are free
No more than you're willing to give
'Cause you won't pay nothin'
For this good lovin'
It's for free
And I won't make you promises
You see I'm gonna be
'm gonna be, we're gonna be
I'm gonna be the very best I can
To be your lover 'cause I understand
The best things in life are free
Now that I've discovered
What you mean to me
The best things in life are free
Now that we've got each other
The best things in life are free
