Yo
Come
On
Move
This
Shake that body
Shake that body
People don't you know, don't you know
Its about time
Can't you hear the jam is pumpin'
While you taste the piece of mine
Many different flavors
And the bass is strong
Get into the hot stuff
Let me pour a little on
Baby let me show you how to do dis
You've gotta move this
You're doing fine
There's nothing to it
You gotta move this
Come on and move this
Shake that body for
People don't you know
Can you feel the mellow crawling fast
Drum oh baby
Rhythms blast
Pump it pump it pump it up
Bet you can't make this once stop
You've gotta move this
You've gotta move this
Shake that body ah
Shake that body cool
People don't
Pump it taken
Fingers snappin'
Hands club and Mamas Rappin'
Talkin' about cold loughin'
Shut up and you the one
Use what you got show me
Your on the floor so let me see
Don't say nothing less I saw
And remember I like it raw
Baby let me show
