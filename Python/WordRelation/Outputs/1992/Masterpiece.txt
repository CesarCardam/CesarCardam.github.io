27. Atlantic Starralbum
A simple touch of your hand
And everything is right
The gentle way you look at me
When we kiss goodnight
You've given me the freedom no other love has known
And now I thank you girl , thank you girl
The countless ways you've touched my heart
Is more than I can say
The beauty that you've shown to me
Takes my breath away
A picture perfect painting, that's what our love is
And yes I need you so, and now I know
Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you my love
Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you
Sometimes I wonder what I'd be
Had I not found you
A least and lonely soul this world
Could show me nothing new
But now my life's a canvas
Painted with your love
And it will always be
And now I see
The gentle walks together
Through time will never pass
This fairy tale we shared
Is real inside our hearts
Let it be forever
Never let it end
This promise I can make
Heaven is ours to take
Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you my love
Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you
When I'm lost and insecure
You build me up and make me sure
That everything will be alright
My love
ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you my love
Ooh
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art it's true
And I treasure you
(This fairy tale we're sharing
Is real inside our hearts
Let it be forever
Never let it end)
