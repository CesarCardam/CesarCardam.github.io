16. Mariah Carey#1&#039;s
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back,
Where there is love, I'll be there. (I'll be there)
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do.
Just call my name and I'll be there. (I'll be there)
I'll be there to comfort you,
Build my world of dreams around you,
I'm so glad that I found you.
I'll be there with a love so strong,
I'll be your strength,
You know I'll keep holdin' on.
Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter,
Togetherness, well it's all I'm after,
Just call my name, and I'll be there. (I'll be there)
I'll be there to protect you, (Yeah baby)
With an unselfish love that respects you.
Just call my name, and I'll be there. (I'll be there)
I'll be there to comfort you,
Build my world of dreams around you,
You know I'm so glad that I found you baby. (So glad baby)
I'll be there with a love so strong,
I'll be your strength, (Be your strength)
You know I'll keep holdin' on.
If you should ever find someone new
I know she better be good to you
'Cause if she doesn't
Then I'll be there (I'll be there)
Don't you know baby, yeah I'll be there
I'll be there
Just call my name, and I'll be there
Yeah, I'll be there baby
You know I'll be there
Just call my name and I'll be there
Just look over your shoulder!
Just call my name and I'll be there
