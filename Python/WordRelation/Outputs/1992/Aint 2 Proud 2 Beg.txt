36. TLCNow &amp; Forever
Yo mic check 1-2, 1-2
We in the house
Yeah come on
1992 TLC kickin' off in your mother
So ya best be duckin' fast
Yo T-Boz is ya being a boss
Chilli what's up wit' dat sauce?
Dis is it
Yo "T" step on that
I ain't 2 proud, I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
Thinkin' short of what you got
Better get it while it's hot
Ain't no better love than your own
Unmistakin' urge 2 be sexin' with society
How can you be happy alone
When I need 2 feel love
Why wait 4 so long
Cause I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
4 something that I call my own
And I want 2 be touched
And feeling so much see cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'
Yo if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
If the lovin' is strong then he got it goin' on and
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
2 inches or a yard rock hard or if it's saggin'
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
So it ain't like I'm braggin' just join the paddywagon cause
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg, I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
Screaming' loud and holdin' sheets
Scsared that you'll be called a freak
Gotta let it go while you can
Ain't 2 proud 2 beg you see
Cause my man belongs 2 me
And I know that he understands
When I need 2 feel love
Why wait 4 so long
Cause I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
4 something that I call my own
And I want 2 be touched
And feeling so much see cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'
Yo if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
If the lovin' is strong then he got it goin' on and
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
2 inches or a yard rock hard or if it's saggin'
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
So it ain't like I'm braggin' just join the paddywagon cause
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg, I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
Yo Left Eye kick that rap
Realize the realism of reality treats
Us both the same
Cause satisfaction is the name of this game
So I choose to explain it's evident
Left Eye don't mean the rest of my body is irrelevant
In other words let's refresh your head
About pullin' down curtains and breakin' thewaterbed
Yeah I like it when you (kiss)
Both sets of lips
Oh on the TLC tip
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (I ain't 2 proud 2 beg)
What I call my own
Just you and me (uh)
Hey
When I need 2 feel love
Why wait 4 so long
Cause I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
4 something that I call my own
And I want 2 be touched
And feeling so much see cause
Everybody needs some good lovin'
Yo if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
If the lovin' is strong then he got it goin' on and
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
2 inches or a yard rock hard or if it's saggin'
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
So it ain't like I'm braggin' just join the paddywagon cause
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg, I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
TLC isn't 2 proud 2 beg
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
