Mornings alone
When you come home
I breath a little faster
Every time we're together
It'd never be the same (it'd never be the same)
If you're not here
How can you stay away (how can you stay away)
Away so long
Why can't we stay together
Give me a reason
Give me a reason
I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
To make it trough the day without you
I, I can't resist
Try to find exactly what I missed
It's just another day without you
It's just another day oh
Making the time
Find the right lines
To make you stay forever
What do I have to tell you
I'm just trying to hold on to something
(Trying to hold on to something good)
Oh give us a chance to make it (give us a chance to make it)
To make it no no no
Don't wanna hold on to never
I'm not that strong
I'm not that strong
I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
To make it trough the day without you
I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I missed
It's just another day without you
Why can't you stay forever
Just give me a reason
Give me a reason
'Cause I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
To make it trough the day without you (don't wanna make it trough the day, no)
I, I can't resist
Trying to find exactly what I missed
It's just another day without you
I, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna find another way
To make it trough the day without you
I, I can't resist
I'm trying to find exactly what I missed
It's just another day without you
