No, you're never gonna get it
Never ever gonna get it (no, not this time)
No, you're never gonna get it (my love)
Never ever gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it
Never ever gonna get it (no, not this time)
No, you're never gonna get it (my love)
Never ever gonna get it
I remember how it used to be
You never was this nice, you can't fool me
Now you talkin' like you made a change
The more you talk, the more things sound the same
What makes you think you can just walk back into her life
Without a good fight? Oh
I just sit back and watch you make a fool of yourself
Cuz you're just wasting your time, oh
No, you're never gonna get it (not this time)
Never ever gonna get it (my lovin')
No, you're never gonna get it (had your chance to make a change)
Never ever gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it (not this time)
Never ever gonna get it (my lovin')
No, you're never gonna get it (had your chance to make a change)
Never ever gonna get it
Now you promise me the moon and stars
Save your breath, you won't get very far
Gave you many chances to make change
The only thing you changed was love to hate
It doesn't matter what you do or what you say
She doesn't love you, no way
Maybe next time you'll give your woman a little respect
So you won't be hearing her say, No way
No, you're never gonna get it (not this time)
Never ever gonna get it (my lovin')
No, you're never gonna get it (had your chance to make a change)
Never ever gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it (not this time)
Never ever gonna get it (my lovin')
No, you're never gonna get it (had your chance to make a change)
Never ever gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it (not this time)
Never ever gonna get it (my lovin')
No, you're never gonna get it (had your chance to make a change)
Never ever gonna get it
No, you're never gonna get it (not this time)
Never ever gonna get it (my lovin')
No, you're never gonna get it (had your chance to make a change)
Never ever gonna get it
Doesn't matter what you do or what you say
She don't love you, no way
Maybe next time you'll give your woman a little respect
So you won't be hearing her say, No way
(And now it's time for a breakdown)
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it
Never gonna get it (whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it
Never gonna get it, never gonna get it
Never gonna get it, never get it
No, you're never gonna get it (sweet lovin')
Never ever gonna get it (sweet lovin')
No, you're never gonna get it (my lovin')
Never ever gonna get it (my lovin')
No, you're never gonna get it (sweet lovin')
Never ever gonna get it (my lovin')
No, you're never gonna get it (sweet lovin')
Never ever gonna get it (my lovin')
