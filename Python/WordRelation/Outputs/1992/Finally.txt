20. CeCe Penistonalbum
Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face and
I just can not hide it
Meeting Mr. Right, the man of my dreams
The one who shows me true love (or at least it seems)
With brown cocoa skin and curly black hair
It's just the way he looks at me that gentle loving stare
Finally you've come along
The way I feel about you,
It just can't be wrong
If you only knew the way I feel about you
I just can't describe it
Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally it has happened to me right in front of my face and
I just can not hide it
