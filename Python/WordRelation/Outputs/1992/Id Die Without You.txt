51. P.M. Dawnalbum
Is it my turn to wish you were lying here.
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping.
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world.
Or even imagine your emotions. Tell myself anything
Is it my turn to hold you by your hands.
Tell you I love you and you not hear me
Is it my turn to totally understand.
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing
[Chorus]
If I have to give away
The feeling that I feel.
If I have to sacrifice
Oh, whatever babe, whatever baby.
If I have to take apart
All that I am
Is there anything that I would not do,
'Cause inside I'd die without you
Yeah baby
'Cause inside I'd die without you
'Cause inside I'd die without you
Oh, I apologize for all the things I've done.
But now I'm underwater and I'm drowning
Is it my turn to be the one to cry.
Isn't it amazing how some things completely turn around
So take every little piece of my heart
Yeah, take every little piece of my soul
Yeah, take every little bitty piece of my mind
'Cause if you're gone inside
I'd die without you
