88. TLCNow &amp; Forever
Every now and the, I get a little crazy,
That's not the way it's supposed to be.
Sometimes my vision is a little hazy,
I can't tell who I should trust or just who I let trust me, yeah.
People try to say I act a little funny,
But that's just a figure of speech to me.
They tell me I changed because I got money,
But if you were there before,
Then you're still down with me.
What about your friends, will they stand their ground,
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends, are they gonna be lowdown,
Will they ever be around,
Or will they turn their backs on you?
Well, is it me, or can it be I'm a little too friendly
So to speak hypothetically.
Say I supply creativity to what others must take as a form of self-hate.
Only to make an enemy which results in unfortunate destiny.
They dog me out then be next to me,
Just cause I am what some choose to envy.
Every now and then, I get a little easy,
I let a lot of people depend on me.
I never thought they would ever deceive me,
Don't you know when times got rough,
I was standing on my own.
I'll never let another get that close to me,
You see I've grown a lot smarter now.
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see,
If your friend is true then they'll be there with you.
What about your friends, will they stand their ground,
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends, are they gonna be lowdown,
Will they ever be around,
Or will they turn their backs on you?
What about your friends, will they stand their ground,
Will they let you down again?
What about your friends, are they gonna be lowdown,
Will they ever be around,
Or will they turn their backs on you?
Yo, is it me, or can it be I'm a little too friendly
So to speak hypothetically.

(What about your friends?)
People say I act a little funny,
I wouldn't change, not for no money.
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me.
(What about your friends?)
Even though I might seem easy,
It don't give you no cause to deceive me.
It's not the way that I want my friends to ever be.
What about your friends, will they stand their ground,
Will they let you down again?
