09. Color Me Baddalbum
I'm so glad you're my girl
I'll do anything for you
Call you every night
And give you flowers to
I thank the Lord for you
And think about you all the time
I ask him everyday
That you'll for-ever be mine
I wanna hold your hand
To show you I'll be there
I like to do the things
That let you know I care
I sing this lullaby
Cause girl you fill me full
I look into your eyes
You're so beautiful
Oh girl I think I love ya
I'm always thinkin' of ya
I want ch-ya to know I do all for love
I love it when we're together
Girl I need you forever
And want you to know I do it all for love
I will never leave you sugar
This I guarantee
I look in to the future
I see you and me
Knight in shining armor
I will be your fairy tale
I wanna take care of you
Girl, I'll serve you well.
I will be there for ya
To catch you when you fall
I'll hold you in my arms
That's where you belong
I sing this lullaby
Cause girl you fill me full
I look in to your eyes
You're so beautiful, beautiful, yeah!
Oh girl I think I love ya
I'm always thinkin' of ya
I want ch-ya to know I do all for love
I love it when we're together
Girl I need you forever
And want you to know I do it all for love
Yo, come here sweetheart
I want you to know something all right
See everyday in my life without you
Is like a hundred years
The distance between us
An ocean of tears
See all the things I do for you
Are for love dig it
All for lovin' (all for love)
All for you (you)
All for lovin' you, you, you, you
Oh girl I think I love ya
I'm always thinkin' of ya
I want ch-ya to know I do all for love
I love it when we're together
Girl I need you forever
And want you to know I do it all for love
