Your reputation caught my attention
I just can't help myself
I want nobody else
You look so fine
Let's spend some time
I want to make love to you
you're all that I want to do
I want to give you
A tasty secret
I want to melt in your hand
Just gotta show you
That I can love you
Until you understand
I want to love you
I want to love you down, baby
I want to love you
I want to love you down, baby
You've got it goin on
With you, I belong
You undress my heart
From the very first start
You do understand me
Give your body to me
If you don't let me go
Let my love overflow
I'm gonna give you
A tasty secret
That's gonna melt in your hand
Just want to show you
That I can love you
Until you understand
I want to love you
I want to love you down, baby
I want to love you
I want to love you down, baby
I want to love you
I want to love you down, baby
I want to love you
I want to love you down, baby
Let me love you
Let me love you down, boy
I love you
Adore me
And I adore, adore, adore, adore you
I want to love you
I want to love you down, baby
I want to love you
I want to love you down, baby
I want to love you
I want to love you down, baby
I want to love you
I want to love you down, baby
I want to love you
I want to love you down, baby
I want to love you
I want to love you down, baby
