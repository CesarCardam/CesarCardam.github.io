98. Def LeppardVault: Def Leppard&#039;s Greatest Hits
Do you want to get rocked?
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
I'm your average ordinary everyday kid
Happy to do nothin'
In fact that's what I did
I got a million ways to make my day
But daddy don't agree
'Cause when I try to get away
He says he got plans for me
Get your butt right out of bed
Stop buggin' me
Get up and move your sleepy head
Don't shake my tree
(He said mow the lawn) who me?
(Walk the dog) not my style, man
(Take out the trash) no way
(Tidy your room) c'mon get real
Sorry dad, gotta disappear
Let's get the rock out of here
Seven day weekend
Up all night
In at the deep end
Hang on tight
Won't take a minute
It won't take long
So get on in it
Come on, c'mon, c'mon
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way
Get it night 'n' day
C'mon let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Drivin' with my baby
To get her in the mood
She's dialin' through my radio
And I'm ready to make my move
But what she got ain't rock 'n' roll
And it really blew my groove
It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
It makes me want to scream
Bach, Tschaikovsky, violins
Turn it off, that ain't my scene
Well I'm sorry girl
Here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question?
Seven day weekend
Up all night
In at the deep end
Hang on tight
Won't take a minute
It won't take long
So get on in it
Come on, c'mon, c'mon
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way
Get it night 'n' day
C'mon let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
All I want to do is
Take a ride into the blue
Every time I want to love you
I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows I'm sick 'n' tired
Of dancin' with this broom
I feel lucky today
Hey look at that, man
Do you want to get rocked?
Do you want to get rocked?
It won't take you a minute
It won't take that long, yeah
Get on, get with it
Oh, c'mon everybody
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Do you want to, do you want to?
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top of it
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Love to rock your body baby
Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Let's go all the way
Let's do it night 'n' day
Let's get out and play
Rock the night away
C'mon let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Do you want to get rocked?
