79. Kathy Troccolialbum
Well you came in my life like a ray of light
Shining through the clouds in my heart
I just looked at you and the world was new
It was right, right from the start
Whoa oh oh oh you came to me
Whoa oh oh oh with a love so sweet
And I'll never never never
Be the same
Everything changes
Nothing looks the same through the eyes of love
Everything changes (everything changes)
When you love some, love some, love someone
Everything changes
Standing in the light of a bright new sun
Everything changes (everything changes)
When you love some, love some, love someone
Everything changes
I'm lookin' around me
And I'm lovin' what I see
'cause I found somebody, somebody who loves me
Whoa oh oh oh you came to me
Whoa oh oh oh with a love so sweet
And I'll never never never
Be the same
Everything changes
Nothing looks the same through the eyes of love
Everything changes (everything changes)
When you love some, love some, love someone
Everything changes
Standing in the light of a bright new sun
Everything changes (everything changes)
When you love some, love some, love someone
Everything changes
