53. Toad The Wet SprocketFear
Nothing's so loud
As hearing when we lie
The truth is not kind
And you've said neither am I
But the air outside so soft
Is saying everything
Everything
All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, hear it say
Nothing's so cold
As closing the heart when all we need
Is to free the soul
But we wouldn't be that brave I know
And the air outside so soft,
Confessing everything
Everything
All I want is to feel this way
To be this close to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say
And it won't matter now
Whatever happens will be
Though the air speaks of all we'll never be
It won't trouble me
All I want is to feel this way
To be this close to feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, I feel it say
And it feels so close
Let it take me in
Let it hold me so
I can feel it say
