87. Color Me Baddalbum
Ooh sock it to me mama
Oh I thought I saw a pussy cat baby (all right)
Ya she looks like she can be my personal steady,
Ya, let me make this move.
Baby I want cha very bad babe (I do)
And I've been wanting you for so long, oh
And I could never love you fast babe (not you)
I take my time and love you all night long
All night, yeah,
You know that I want your love
Let me make it right, for you
All night, you're the one I'm thinking of
Once I make it right
Baby I know you will never go (talk to me ma'ma)
Slow
[Chorus]
I like to love you in slow motion
Ooh ya got it goin' on (slow)
Let me love you slow, slow
I like to love you slow so morning will come before I do
Let me love you, slow (slow motion is better then no motion, baby)
Ah, come on
My motor is round
You got this animal hype in ya
I gotta slow it down
To get my timing right
Baby I think you're very sexy (sing the song, sing the song) I do
Come over here and get a little bit closer to me, yeah
The time has come for me to love you real slow, slow
Motion lover is what they call me! (good God!)
[Chorus]
(how do you want to do it baby)
Oh twenty miles an hour is the speed I drive (all night)
Ain't nothin' wrong, I just take my time.
(yeah but-)yo check this out (yeah, hey, hey)
Don't get offended if I fall for a little behind baby, yeah! (all right)
Twenty miles an hour and uh, your rump is mine yeah!
[Chorus]
All night, you know that I want your love
Let me make it right, for you
(tie my hands behind my back baby)
All night (you see where I am coming from)
Your the one I'm thinkin' of
Once I make it right.
Oh make it good is my national anthem baby
Some slow and sloppy loven,
Is worth gold and diamonds
Like a turtle and hare - I promise I will be there
(oh am I in? On my honor I will do my best to steal all I can
And bonk the rest. Yeah!
You all just as crazy as joy!
