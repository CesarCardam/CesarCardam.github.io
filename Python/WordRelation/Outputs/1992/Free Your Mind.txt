I wear tight clothing and high heel shoes
It doesn't mean that I'm a prostitute
I like rap music wear hip hop clothes
That doesn't mean that I'm sellin' dope
Oh please forgive me, for having straight hair
It doesn't mean there's another blood in my heirs
I might date another race or color
Doesn't mean I don't like my strong black brothers
Why oh why must it be this way
Before you can read me you gotta learn how to see me, I said
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be colour blind, don't be so shallow.
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be colour blind, don't be so shallow
So I'm a sistah
Buy things with cash
That really doesn't mean that all my credit's bad, oooh
So why dispute me and waste my time
Because you really think the price is high for me
I can't look without being watched, no
You rang my buy before I made up my mind, ow!
Oh now attitude, why even bother
I can't change your mind, you can't change my colour
Why oh why must it be this way?
Before you can read me you gotta learn how to see me, I said
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be colour blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be colour blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be colour blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind and the rest will follow
Be colour blind, don't be so shallow
Free your mind
