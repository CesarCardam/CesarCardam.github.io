65. Mario Featuring Gucci Mane & Sean GarrettD.N.A.
I love you but I don't think
I can love you anymore
When I kiss you so good,
Why would you wanna break up?
When this loving is so good,
Why would you wanna break up?
When I hit that so good,
Why would you wanna break up?
When this feeling is so good,
Why would you wanna break up?
Loving you, loving you, loving you
When I'm, when I'm
Loving you, loving you
Why would you wanna break up?
Do anything for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See I been driving through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?
Now baby girl have dumped me
She no longer wants me
I'm no longer hired
She says that I've been fired
On to the next one
More fish in the sea
Girls are like buses
Miss one, Next 15 one comin'
Gucci Mane crazy and his ice game stunnin'
Swag so stupid still the bitch straight dumped me
Over, no more smokin' doja
Baby girl went AWOL
She used to be my soulja
(Don't) Don't I lace you with the Gucci
(Don't) Don't I deck you in the Louis
(Don't) don't I make your earlobes freeze
(Don't) don't when I dive I dive deep ?
I know I be, gone
I know I be, gone
I know I be, (flirtin' with them girls)
I know I be, said I'd be right back, but take to long.
I know I be, saying I be faithful but I don't
I know I be,
Making you them promises
Then breaking you're heart again
Telling you she wasn't, who she was
Then we arguing, but baby (I love you)
Loving you, loving you, loving you
