86. Jesse McCartney Featuring LudacrisDeparture
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
Been missing you crazy
How do you do
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep how do you sleep.
I tried my best at moving on have yet to find a girl like you
I see things that I didn't before and I'm wishing I had more time with you,
How do you stay awake knowing all I do is think of you
All the things we thought about that never will happen again if I could just see you
If I had my way I'll get'cha girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Around my way where we used to park and did all those things.
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
Been missing you crazy
How do you do
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep how do you sleep.
How do you how do you sleep how do you sleep
Baby all that I hear from my friends again and again (they come and ask about you) (they say)
We saw your girl at the game and dang we gotta say a big mistake by you.
Not only does your body bang but I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you couldn't sleep can't think can't eat till I come see you
If I had my way I'll get'cha girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Around my way where we used to park and did all those things.
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
Been missing you crazy
How do you do
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep how do you sleep.
It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
Been missing you crazy
How do you do
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep how do you sleep.
