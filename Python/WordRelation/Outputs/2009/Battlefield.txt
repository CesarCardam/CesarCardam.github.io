57. Jordin SparksBattlefield
Don't try to explain your mind
I know what's happening here
One minute, it's love
And, suddenly, it's like a battlefield
One word turns into a war
Why is it the smallest things that tear us down
My world's nothing when you're gone
I'm out here without a shield, can't go back, now
Both hands tied behind my back for nothing, oh no
These times when we climb so fast to fall, again
Why we gotta fall for it, now
I never meant to start a war
You know, I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
Why does love always feel like
Can't swallow our pride
Neither of us wanna raise that flag, mm
If we can't surrender
Then, we're both gonna lose we have, oh, no
Both hands tied behind my back for nothing (nothing) oh no
These times when we climb so fast to fall, again
I don't wanna fall for it, now
I never meant to start a war
You know, I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
Better go and get your armor
(get your armor) get your armor (get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your armor
(get your armor) get your armor (get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your
We could pretend that we are friends, tonight (oh)
And, in the morning, we wake up, and we'd be alright
Cause, baby, we don't have to fight
And I don't want this love to feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
I guess you better go and get your armor
I never meant to start a war
You know, I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know we're fighting for
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield
I guess you better go and get your armor
(get your armor) get your armor (get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your armor
(get your armor) get your armor (get your armor)
Why does love always feel like (oh, oh)
Why does love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield
I never meant to start a war
Don't even know what we're fighting for
I never meant to start a war
Don't even know what we're fighting for
