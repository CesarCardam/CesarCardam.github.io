30. 3OH!3Want
Black dress, with the tights underneath,
I've got the breath of the last cigarette on my teeth.
And she's an actress, but she ain't got no need.
She's got money from parents in a trust fund back east.
Tongues, always pressed to your cheeks.
While my tongue is on the inside of some other girl's teeth.
Tell your boyfriend, if he says he's got beef,
That I'm a vegetarian, and I ain't fucking scared of him.
She wants to touch me
She wants to love me
She'll never leave me
Don't trust a ho.
Never trust a ho.
Won't trust a ho
(Cause the ho) won't trust me.
She wants to touch me
She wants to love me
She'll never leave me
Don't trust a ho.
Never trust a ho.
Won't trust a ho
(Cause the ho) won't trust me.
X's on the back of your hands,
Wash them in the bathroom to drink like the bands,
And the set list, you stole off the stage
Has red and purple lipstick all over the page.
Bruises cover your arms
Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm,
And the best is, no one knows who you are.
Just another girl alone at the bar.
She wants to touch me
She wants to love me
She'll never leave me
Don't trust a ho.
Never trust a ho.
Won't trust a ho
(Cause the ho) won't trust me.
She wants to touch me
She wants to love me
She'll never leave me
Don't trust a ho.
Never trust a ho.
Won't trust a ho
(Cause the ho) won't trust me.
Shush girl, shut your lips,
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips.
I said shush girl, shut your lips.
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips.
I said shush girl, shut your lips.
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips.
She wants to touch me
She wants to love me
She'll never leave me
Don't trust a ho.
Never trust a ho.
Won't trust a ho
(Cause the ho) won't trust me.
She wants to touch me
She wants to love me
She'll never leave me
Don't trust a ho.
Never trust a ho.
Won't trust a ho
(Cause the ho) won't trust me.
