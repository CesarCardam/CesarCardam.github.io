56. AkonFreedom
It's been so long
That I haven't seen your face
I'm tryna be strong
But the strength I have is washing away
It wont be long before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you
Tell you what's been on my mind
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
Girl I know, mistakes were made between us two
And we show our ass that night even said somethings weren't true
Why'd you go and haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be the way it was
Cause you were my homie, lover and friend
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
I can't lie
I miss you much
Watching everyday that goes by
I miss you much
Till I get you back I'm gonna cry
Yes I miss you much
Cause you are the apple of my eye
Girl I miss you much
I miss you much
I can't lie
I miss you much
Watching everyday that goes by
I miss you much
Tell I get you back I'm gonna cry
Yes I miss you much
Yes you are the apple of my eye
Girl I miss you much

I wanna make up right now na na

I want you to fly with me
Want you to fly
I miss how you lie with me
Miss how you lie
Just wish you could dine with me
Wish you could dine with me
One that would grind with me
One that would grind with me
I want you to fly with me
Want you to fly
I miss how you lie with me
Oh miss how you lie
Just wish you could dine with me
Wish you could dine
One that would grind with me
Oh one that would grind
I wanna make up right now na na
