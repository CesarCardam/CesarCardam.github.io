I'll make them good girls go bad
I'll make them good girls go
Good girls go
(good girls go)
I know your type
Yeah daddy's little girl
Just take a bite (one bite)
Let me shake up your world
Cause just one night couldn't be so wrong
I'm gonna make you lose control
She was so shy
Till I drove her wild
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go bad
You were hanging in the corner
With your five best friends
You heard that I was trouble but you couldn't resist
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go
Good girls go
(good girls go)
(good girls go)
I know your type
Boy you're dangerous
Yeah you're that guy
I'd be stupid to trust
But just one night couldn't be so wrong
You make me want to lose control
She was so shy
'Til I drove her wild
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go bad
I was hanging in the corner
With my five best friends
I heard that you were trouble but I couldn't resist
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go
Good girls go
(good girls go)
(good girls go)
Oh she got a way with them boys in the place
Treat em like they don't stand a chance
And he got a way with them girls in the back
Actin' like they too hot to dance
Oh she got a way with them boys in the place
Treat em like they don't stand a chance
And he got a way with them girls in the back
Actin' like they too hot to dance
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go
Them good girls go bad
(good girls go)
I was hanging in the corner
With my five best friends
I heard that you were trouble but I couldn't resist
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go bad
I make the good girls go
(good girls go)
(good girls go)
