73. Asher RothAsleep in the Bread Isle
I'm nice right now, I, I feel good
If you have a drink
Would you please put it in the air
That party last night was awfully crazy
I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three wake up at ten
Go out to eat then do it again
I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip bankers club and drink miller lite
On thirsty Thursday and Tuesday night ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup
Lets get fucked up
I'm next on the table
Who want what
I am champion at beer pong
Allen Iverson Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it
Otherwise you naked
Time isn't wasted when you're getting wasted
Woke up today and all I could say is
That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three wake up at ten
Go out to eat then do it again
Man I love college (hey) and I love drinking (hey)
I love women (hey) man I love college
I can't tell you what I learned from school
But I could tell you a story or two
Um yea of course I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house till the booze gone
And don't have sex if shes too gone
When it comes to condoms put two on
Then tomorrow night find a new joint
Hold the beer bong
Nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted when you're getting wasted
Woke up today and all I could say is
That party last night was awfully crazy I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three wake up at ten
Go out to eat then do it again
Man I love college (hey) and I love drinking (hey)
I love women (hey) I love college
Now if everybody would please
Put their drink as high as they can
As high as they can
And repeat after me
Chug chug chug chug chug chug chug chug
Freshman freshman freshman freshman
Do something crazy do something crazy do something crazy do something crazy
Keg-stand keg-stand keg-stand keg-stand
Yea, that party last night
Man I love college, I love it
That party last night
Goodnight everybody I gotta head back to class for a little bit
That party last night was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off and had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three wake up at ten
Go out to eat then do it again man I love college
Do I really have to graduate or can I just stay here for the rest of my life
