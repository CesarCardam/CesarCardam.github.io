12. T.I. Featuring Justin Timberlakealbum
Ooh, I've been travelin' on this road too long
Just trying to find, my way back home
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ooh, I've been travelin' on this road too long
Just trying to find, my way back home
The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone
Ever had one of dem days, you wish woulda' stayed home
Run into a group of niggas, getting they hate on
You walk by, they get wrong you reply
Then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you'll get your head ?
That next, they don't wanna stop
There now they bussin', now you gushin', ambulance
Rushin' you to the hospital, with a bad concussion
Plus ya hit four times, plus it hit ya
Spine paralyzed waist down, now ya wheel chair bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think it all started you, fussin' with three guys
Now ya pride in the way, but ya pride is the way you
Could fuck around, get shot die any day
Niggas die, every day all over
Bull shit dope money dice, game ordinary hood shit
Could this be, 'cause of hip hop music
Or did the ones, with the good sense
Not use it, usually niggas
Don't know what to do, when their back against the wall
So they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blo' I guess
From Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it now I take time to think
Before I make mistakes, just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday, the heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say, the old me dead and gone away
