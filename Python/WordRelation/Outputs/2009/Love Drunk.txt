72. Boys Like GirlsLove Drunk
The top down in the summer sun
The day we met was like a hit an run
An I still taste it on my tongue (taste it on my tongue)
The sky was burning up like fireworks
You made me want you oh so bad it hurt
But girl, in case you haven't heard
I used to be love drunk
But now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever
Forever is over
We used to kiss all night
Now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me crying
Say hello to goodbye
'Cause just one sip would make me sick
I used to be love drunk
But now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever
But now it's over
Hot sweat and blurry eyes
We're spinning on a roller coaster ride
The world stuck in black and white (stuck in black and white)
You drove me crazy every time we touched
But now I'm so broken that I can't get up
Oh girl, you make me such a lush
I used to be love drunk
But now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever
Forever is over
We used to kiss all night
Now its just a bar fight
So don't call me crying
Say hello to goodbye (oh yeah)
'Cause just one thing (oh yeah)
would make me say
I used to be love drunk
But now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever
But now its over
All the time I wasted on you
All the bullshit you put me through
I'm checking into rehab 'cause everything we had
Didn't mean a thing to you
I used to be love drunk
But now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever
But now I'm sober
I used to be love drunk
But now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever
Forever is over
We used to kiss all night
Now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me crying
Say hello to goodbye (oh yeah)
'Cause just one thing (oh yeah)
Would make me say
I used to be love drunk
But now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever
But now its over
Now it's over
Still taste it on my tongue
Now it's over
