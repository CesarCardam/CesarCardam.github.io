Blame it on the booze
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on 'tron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol
Hey she say she usually don't
But I know that she front
'Cause shawty know what she want
But she don't wanna seem like she easy
I hear you saying what ya wont do
But you know we probably goin' do
What you been feigning deep inside
Don't lie now
Girl what you drinking?
Goin' let sink in
Here for the weekend
Thinking
We can
See what we can be if we press press forward
Just one more round and you're down I'll pouring
Fill another cup up
Feeling on yo butt what?
You don't even care now
I was unaware how fine you was
Before my buzz set in,
My buzz set in
Blame it on the booze
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on 'tron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue top
Got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol
Oopsy
She spilled some drank on me
And now I'm knowing she's tipsy
She put her body on me
And she keep staring me right in my eyes
No telling what I'm going do
Baby I'd rather show you
What you been missing in your life when I get inside.
Girl what you drinking?
Goin' let sink in
Here for the weekend
Thinking
We can
See what we can be if we press fast forward
Just one more round and if you're down I'll pouring
Fill another cup up
Feeling on yo butt what?
I was unaware how fine you was
Before my buzz set in,
My buzz set in
Blame it on the booze
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on 'tron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue top
Got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol
(T-Pain!)
Girl, I know you feel good
Just like you look, couple more shots
You open up like a book, I ain't trippin 'cause I'ma read ya
Shawty, I ain't trippin', I jus' wanna please ya
I'ma take a shot of Nuvo, shawty, didn't you know
It's going down, we can go kick it like Judo
You know what I mean
Shawty got drunk, thought it all was a dream
So I made her say I, I
Now she got her hand on my leg
Got my seats all wet in my ride
All over my ride, all over my ride
She look me dead in the eye
Then my pants got bigga
She already knew what to figga
Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like, I, I
Blame it on the booze
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on 'tron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue top
Got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol
Now to the ballas poppin' bottles
With they Henny in they cups screamin'
Money ain't a thing, if it ain't throwin' it up in the sky
Hold your drinks up high (high)
And to my independent mommas
Who can buy they own bottles
If you lookin' like a model
When them broke fellas holla, tell 'em, bye
Hold your drinks up high
Blame it on the booze
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on 'tron
Got you in the zone
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the vodka
Blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the blue top
Got you feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a a a a a alcohol
Blame it on the a a a a a a alcohol
