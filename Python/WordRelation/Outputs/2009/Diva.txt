I'm-a a diva (hey)
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)
I'm-a, I'm-a
Na, na, na, diva is a female version of a hustler
Of a hustler
Of a, of a hustler
Na, na, na, diva is a female version of a hustler
Of a hustler
Of a, of a hustler
Stop the track; let me state facts
I told you give me a minute and I'll be right back
Fifty million 'round the world and they said that I couldn't get it
I done got so sick and filthy with Benj's I can't spend
How you gone be talking shit? You act like I just got up in it
Been the number one diva in this game for a minute
I know you read the paper, the one that they call a queen
Every radio 'round the world know me 'cause that's where I be
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)
I'm-a, I'm-a
Na, na, na, diva is a female version of a hustler
Of a hustler
Of a, of a hustler
Na, na, na, diva is a female version of a hustler
Of a hustler
Of a, of a hustler
When he pull up, wanna pop my hood up
Bet he better have a six pack in the cooler
Getting money--divas getting money
If you ain't getting money, then you ain't got nothing for me
Tell me something (tell me something)
Where your boss at? (where your boss at?)
Where my ladies up in there that like to talk back? (that like to talk back)
I wanna see ya (I wanna see ya)
I'd like to meet ya (I'd like to meet her)
What you said? (Not to me)
She ain't no diva (she ain't no diva)
Na, na, na, diva is a female version of a hustler
Of a hustler
Of a, of a hustler
Na, na, na, diva is a female version of a hustler
Of a hustler
Of a, of a hustler
Since fifteen in my stilettos been strutting in this game
What's your age was the question they asked when I hit the stage
I'm a diva; best believe her; you see her; she getting paid
She ain't calling him to greet her; don't need him--her bed's made
This is a stick up, stick up
I need them bags of that money
A stick up, stick up
You see them; ask 'em where that money
All my ladies get it up
I see you, I do the same
Take it to another level
No passengers on my plane
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
This is a stick up, stick up
I need them bags of that money
Stick up, stick up
You see 'em; ask where that money
Na, na, na, diva is a female version of a hustler
Of a hustler
Of a, of a hustler
Na, na, na, diva is a female version of a hustler
Of a hustler
Of a, of a hustler
I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva
I'm-a, I'm-a a diva (hey)
