61. Justin Timberlake Featuring T.I.FutureSex / LoveSounds
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (what would you do)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular (tell me would you)
Well baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (saying I do)
Because, I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sitting in the grass laying side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin crazy
See all I want you to do is be my love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love, my love, my love, my love
Now if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote (what would you do)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team (tell me would you)
See what's the point in waiting anymore
'Cause girl I've never been more sure (that baby it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waiting for (just saying I do)
Because, I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sitting in the grass laying side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin crazy
See all I want you to do is be my love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love, my love, my love, my love
It's time to get it jt
I don't what she hesitatin' for man
Shorty, cool as a fan on the move once again
But he still has fam from peru to japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls really wild, throw they hands up high
When you wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't seen wit a man so fly
Friends so fly I can go fly private, 'cause I handle mine
B.I., they call me candle guy, simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try, you don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go, why?
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it, when I ain't so high
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy
Ain't gonna lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will
Because, I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sitting in the grass laying side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin crazy
See all I want you to do is be my love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love, my love, my love, my love
