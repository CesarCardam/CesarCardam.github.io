95. T.I.King
T.I.P Pimpin'
Ay shawty why u wanna act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' be nice to ya
Go and tell a nigga no wit an ass so fat
Hey why u wanna go and do that love huh?
Hey why u wanna go and do that do dat
Hey why u wanna go and do dat dat dat
And the relationship been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey why u wanna go and do that love huh
Hey why u wanna go and do that do dat
Hey why u wanna go and do dat dat dat
Can't help but notice how ya glowin' I can see in ya face
Now I just wonder if he know he close to bein' replaced
Swear I treat u like a queen u put me in his place
So you could give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing that u need ya space
Tell the niggas one thing u don?t need to chase
I wanna kiss u everywhere between ya knees and waist
Hear the sounds that u make and get ya knees to shake
Holla at me in the A you feel u need to escape
Got a mansion and a gate, you wit me and you safe
There?s a phantom and a truck wit 23's to skate
600 g's in the safe how much cheese it take
This a chance u need to take it ain't no need to wait
Say the word we can leave today it's somethin' special and it feel like fate
Hate to make a mistake
How the same thing makin' ya sad makin' ya stay
Can he touch it like that and make it feel like this
How he left and came back and it's still like this
Do he hit it from the back and make u feel it in ya chest
Take advantage of what you concealin' in ya dress
What he think he too fresh to show u that u the best
Compliment u on ya intellect and treat u wit respect
Make u sex till u sweat tongue kissin' on ya neck
It's been a while since u got it like this I bet
And I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this not yet
Know u confused ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how u keep sayin' no when ya panties so wet?
Ay
This nigga playin' mind games man
I think the time came that ya mind changed ya understand?
Life is like a chess move u need to make the next move ya best move
Keep it pimpin' ya understand?
Hey
I mean you know I'm sayin' I showed u how I feel you know what I'm sayin'
I put myself all the way out there you know
Ball in your court man but I jus got one question for u
Is you happy?
