33. Fall Out BoyFrom Under the Cork Tree
She says she's no good with words but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out
A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue
And weighed down with words too overdramatic
Tonight it's "it can't get much worse"
Vs. "no one should ever feel like"
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
I need them just to get by
We will own your thoughts
We'll own the songs stuck in your head
We'll leave you kicking and screaming so you can thank us in the end
Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance this is the way they'd look
If they knew how misery loved me
(I only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me, crawling into bed with me)
You always fold just before you're found out
Drink up its last call
Last resort
But only the first mistake and I
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all i have so I write them
I need them just to get by
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (with love)
Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance this is the way they'd look
If they knew how misery loved me
Why don't you show me a little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress (with love)
I only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me
Dance, dance
Dance, dance
Dance, dance
Dance, dance
