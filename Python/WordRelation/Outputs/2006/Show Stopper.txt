We in the car
We ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare
We smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah
Show stoppin' at the latest bar
The ride shinin' with the open top
Hydraulics make our heads go nod
Hair blowin' in the breeze
Yo, we superstars
Put in the keys
Make that engine purr
Three in the back, one in the passenger
Slow creepin' 'cause we look that fly
All the boys tryin' taste our candy ride
We in the car
We ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare
We smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah
[Bridge]
Bet you ain't never seen
Chicks ridin' this clean
Louis Vuitton seats
We do it deadly
This how we keep it poppin'
Make sure that bass knockin'
So when you see us ridin'
We call it show stoppin'
[Chorus]
We show stoppin'
We show, show stoppin'
We show stoppin'
We show, show stoppin'
That's how we keep it poppin'
Make sure that bass knockin'
So when you see us ridin'
We call it show stoppin'
We sittin' on twenty-twos plus two
Mink bucket seats, neon blue
Color coordinate with them shoes
Yeah, we divas
But we ride like big boys do
Black tinted with a white stripe interstate
Lookin' in the mirror at my Bad Boy fitted, yup
Show stoppin' till they lose their breath
Turn the wheel to the right
Turn the wheel to the left
We in the car
We ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare
We smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
This is for my ladies in the 280s Mercedes
In the H3, baby Ranges, Bentley Coupes, my Escalades
Say oh, oh
Break 'em off somethin' proper
Like a real show stopper
This is for my chicas with the Beamers A6s
67 Chevy's, Maserati, or a Lexus
Say oh, oh
Break 'em off somethin' proper
Like a real show stopper
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Tonight we goin' swervin'
Bustin' slides, hittin' curbs
And ghost ridin' on the whips
Hit tonight
That's what it's gonna be about
Watch my trunk go bouncy bounce
Girls gon' ridin'
I know you see a wifey
But peep my ride go hyphy
