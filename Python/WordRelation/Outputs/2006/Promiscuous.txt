03. Nelly Furtado Featuring Timbalandalbum
Am I throwing you off?
Nope!
Didn't think so
How ya doing young lady
The feeling that you gave me really drives me crazy
You don't have a player on your trunk
I was at a loss of words
First time that we spoke
If your looking for a girl that'll treat you right
If you looking for her in the day time in the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, give me one chance
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand
I'll be the first to admit it, I'm curious about you, you seem so loose
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute
Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy
You already know
That I'm all yours
What you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need
Promiscuous boy
Let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll
You ready?
Roses are red
Some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead
But you're still kind a cute
Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come too
I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas
Last name Crown
Recognize game
I'm a lay mine's down
I'm a big girl I can handle myself
But if I get lonely I may need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else.
Baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?
Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy
You already know
That I'm all yours
What you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need
Promiscuous boy
Let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll
You ready?
Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean
Hey! Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean
Wait! I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on
I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?
You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Is it the truth, are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?
Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And its you that I want
Promiscuous boy
I'm calling your name
But you're driving me crazy
The way you're making me wait
Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need
Promiscuous boy
We're one in the same
So we don't gotta play games no more
