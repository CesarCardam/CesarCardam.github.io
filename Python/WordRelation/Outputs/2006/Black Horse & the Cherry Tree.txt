Two, three, four
(Woo, hoo, woo, hoo)
(Woo, hoo, woo, hoo)
Well, my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking
(Woo, hoo, woo, hoo)
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
(Woo, hoo, woo, hoo)
I fell in fear upon my back
I said don't look back, just keep on walking
(Woo, hoo, woo, hoo)
When the big black horse that looked this way
Said, hey lady, will you marry me?
(Woo, hoo, woo, hoo)
But I said no, no, no, no, no, no
I said, no, no, you're not the one for me
No, no, no, no, no, no
I said, no, no, you're not the one for me
(Ooo, woo, hoo)
And my heart had a problem in the early hours
So it stopped it dead for a beat or two
(Woo, hoo, woo, hoo)
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done that
And it won't forgive me after all these years
(Woo, hoo, woo, hoo)
So I sent her to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
(Woo, hoo, woo, hoo)
Now it won't come back 'cause it's oh-so-happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see
(Woo, hoo, woo, hoo)
But it said no, no, no, no, no, no
I said, no, no, you're not the one for me
No, no, no, no, no, no
Said, no, no, you're not the one for me
(Ooo, woo, hoo) (not the one for me, yeah)
(Ooo, woo, hoo)
Said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You're not the one for me
Said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You're not the one for me
Big black horse and a cherry tree
I can't quite get there 'cause they've all forsaken me
Big black horse and a cherry tree
I can't quite get there 'cause they've all forsaken me
