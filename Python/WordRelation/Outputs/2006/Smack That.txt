66. Akon Featuring EminemKonvicted
Shady, Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, could she be that lady?
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club now and wardrobe intact now!
I feel it down and cracked now (ooh)
I see it dull and backed now
I'm gonna call her, than I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now!
I feel you creeping, I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh
Ooh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a lil' drink on, they gonna flip for this Akon shit
You can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, she's like "YOU'RE -"
I'm like, "Yeah, I know, let's cut to the chase"
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact he is the one singing the song that's playin' (Akon!)
I feel you creeping, I can you see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh
Eminem is rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bo and all marvelous them rollin'
Women just hoein', big booty rollin'
Soon I'll be all in them and throwing D
Hitting no less than three
Block wheel style like whee
Girl, I can tell you want me, 'cause lately
I feel you creeping, I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'till you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh
