71. Bon JoviHave a Nice Day
I spent twenty years trying to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
I been there, done that
But I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
I been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I went as far as I could
I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I lived a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take, I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy
But not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go home?
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy born a rolling stone
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It doesn't matter where you are
It doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles away or just a mile up the road
Take it in
Take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home?
Who says you can't go back?
Been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I wanna go
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Who says you can't go home?
