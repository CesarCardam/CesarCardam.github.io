60. Jamie Foxx Featuring LudacrisUnpredictable
Yeah, ladies I know you tired of the same old thing
Things have become so mundane
I mean your bedroom is just so cold, it's so cold, but I'm here to tell you
I got a strategy we 'bout to heat it up (Oh, I like that)
Girl get comfortable
We 'bout to do something you never done before
Baby, not the usual
Tonight we gettin' unpredictable
So try to roll with me baby, baby
I'm a make you feel like you never felt
Girl all because you let me get unpredictable
Baby, one plus one ain't two when you with me
C ain't after A and B when you with me
It don't make sense right now but it will
Later on when you see how I make you feel
Regular ain't in my vocabulary
When it comes to love makin' neither is missionary
Positions, girl pick one, better yet some
Never mind that we tryin' all of 'em so
Girl get comfortable
We 'bout to do something you never done before
Baby not the usual
Tonight we gettin' unpredictable
So try to roll with me baby, baby
I'm a make you feel like you never felt
Girl all because you let me get unpredictable yeah
I know you're used to dinner and a movie
Why not be my dinner while makin' a movie?
Do you get it, get it? Do you got it, got it?
Good, good, good, girl, I knew you would
See, what I got over a lot of fellas
Is that I'm more creative
And soon you will see what I mean, what I mean, so
Girl, get comfortable
We 'bout to do something you never done before
Baby not the usual
Tonight we gettin' unpredictable
So try to roll with me baby, baby
I'm a make you feel like you never felt
Girl all because you let me get unpredictable
All aboard!
The spontaneous express
Never the less, always the more
From the pool table to the kitchen floor
Next stop's the G spot
Luda! Ha ha ha (I like this)
I like it too, baby
Let me put a little bit of excitement, up in yo' lifestyle
You gotta know the times of the essence
I'm talkin' right now, I can get, get rid of that headache
What you doin' tonight?
Some say that sex is overrated
But they just ain't doin' it right
I keeps it interestin' baby, just take them clothes off
I'll be yo' Tylenol, just take me till you doze off
Wake you up in the middle of the night and take you to another world
You'll wake up in the mornin' feelin' like another girl
Girl get comfortable
We 'bout to do something you never done before
Baby not the usual
Tonight we gettin' unpredictable
So try, so try, so come and baby
I'm a make you feel like you never felt
Girl all because you let me get unpredictable
