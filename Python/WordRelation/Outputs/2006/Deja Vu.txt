75. Beyonce Featuring Jay-Zalbum
Bass
Uh
Hi hat
Uh
808
Uh
Jay
Uh huh
Ready?
Uh huh
Let's go get 'em
Uh huh
Come on
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass, hi hat, and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birken Bags
Now I bag B (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere--the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whipping curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting
Stand back
Baby, seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you; helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
Oh
[Chorus]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's deja vu
Seeing things that I know can't be
Am I dreaming? When I saw you walking past me
Almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go, oh
[Chorus]
Yes, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl, you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro'
'Cause you gon' need help tryin' to study my bounce
Flow, blow--what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough--po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go; my dough keep the scales tipping
Like four-fours, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow, wind so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argument
I don't make the list; don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one-to-one, nothin' after me
No deja vu, just me and my, oh
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having deja vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane; I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you
That I'm having deja vu?
Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing
I can't let it go
[Chorus: x2]
