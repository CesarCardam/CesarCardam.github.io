Here we go
They say
He do a little this
He do a little that
He always in trouble (and I heard)
Hes nuthin' but a pimp
Hes done a lot of chicks
Hes always in the club (and they say)
He think he slick
He's got a lot of chips
He's sellin' drugs (and I heard)
He's been locked up
Find somebody else
He ain't nuthin' but a thug
So what(Repeat x4)
And they say
I'm a slut
I'm a ho
I'm a freak
I got a different gurl everyday of the week
You too smart
You'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard that they say about me
They say that I'm this
They say that I'm that
But all of its fiction
None of its fact
But you don't be hearin' it about your lover
You let it go in one ear and out the other
Now he say she say they say I heard
If they fake we cant let it get on our nerves
She miserable
She just want you to be like her
Misery needs company
So don't listen to that vine of grapes
They're nuthin' but liars hatin'
And I bet
They wouldnt mind tradin places
With you by my side in my Mercedes
They say
He do a little this
He do a little that
He always in trouble (and I heard)
Hes nuthin' but a pimp
Hes done a lot of chicks
Hes always in the club (and they say)
He think he slick
He's got a lot of chips
He's sellin' drugs (and I heard)
He's been locked up
Find somebody else
He ain't nuthin' but a thug
So what(Repeat x4)
Tell em CiCi
Mo money mo problems
Life of a legend
Haters throw salt like rice at a weddin'
So what
That's your cousin
That don't mean nuthin'
Her like missin' is a type of affection you get
You just blind to the facts
See the lies just as obvious as cries for attention
Yield to the blindness to apply your suspicion
But listen
Say you love me
Gotta trust me
Why you stress this high school mess
Break up never
They just jealous
Drama from your mother
Mean mug from your brother
I'm that author of the book
They can judge from the cover
(Yes)I been to jail
(And yes)I'm grindin' for real
I'm a positive talkin' negative pimp
They hate to see you doin' better than them
So
They say
He do a little this
He do a little that
He always in trouble (and I heard)
Hes nuthin' but a pimp
Hes done a lot of chicks
Hes always in the club (and they say)
He think he slick
He's got a lot of chips
He's sellin' drugs (and I heard)
He's been locked up
Find somebody else
He ain't nuthin' but a thug
So what(Repeat x4)
Ladies and gentlemen
Ciara
Some people don't like it
Cuz you hang out in the street
But you my boyfriend
You've always been here for me
This love is serious
No matter what people think
I'm gon be here for ya
And I don't care what they say (Repeat x2)
They say
He do a little this
He do a little that
He always in trouble (and I heard)
Hes nuthin' but a pimp
Hes done a lot of chicks
Hes always in the club (and they say)
He think he slick
He's got a lot of chips
He's sellin' drugs (and I heard)
He's been locked up
Find somebody else
He ain't nuthin' but a thug
So what(Repeat x4)
