70. Yung Joc Featuring Brandy 'Ms. B.' HambrickNew Joc City
Inny, meeny, minny mo
How many bitches from the club won't go?
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
I'm like inny, meeny, minny, mo
How many niggas from the club won't go?
(I know you saw it, I know you see it)
Now you can call me tip drill, they playing my song
Throw a couple ones, then she throw away her thong
When she bust it open, take a picture with my phone
She love my cologne, I call it perk body zone
Now she pussy poppin'; it's goin' down
Slap the waitress on the booty, tell her "get another round"
And when I make it rain money all over the ground
Fresh force ones, Sean John button down
And then I'm like "Oh, boy, a clique full a stars"
Big four fifth, big dick, and big cars
At the end of the day, when it's all said and done
I need four freaks 'cause I need more than one
[Chorus]
Inny, meeny, minny, mo
How many bitches from the club won't go?
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
I'm like bim bam, I know you want some
She chewing on the dick like a piece of bubblegum
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
I'm like inny, meeny, minny, mo
How many niggas from the club won't go?
(I know you saw it, I know you see it)
I'm like bim bam, I know you want some
You chewing on the pussy like a piece of bubble gum
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
I ain't never been the type to show off in the club
Real laid back, poppin' plenty bottles of
Bub, don't smoke, but I got much perk
Get that nigga real high, make him slurp it then burp
Could you be a groupie?
I hear you singin' my song
Like I see you, lemme feel your tongue
It's T, miss B nigga, let me get you laced
Take a step back, blow the pussy in ya face
I ain't talking kush, nigga, I'm talking a rat race
So many to choose from, give 'em all a little taste
Gotta house full a pussy, the madam of hip hop
My bitches are superstars, so gushy you need a mop
Yeah
[Chorus]
I got stacks on deck, snowflakes on my neck
New J's on my feet, make my outfit complete
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
I got stacks on deck, niggas love my flow
Got a mohawk blowin', air forces that glow
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
Inny, meeny, minny, mo
How many bitches from the club won't go?
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
I'm like bim bam, I know you want some
She chewing on the dick like a piece of bubblegum
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
I'm like inny, meeny, minny, mo
How many niggas from the club won't go?
(I know you see it, I know you see it)
