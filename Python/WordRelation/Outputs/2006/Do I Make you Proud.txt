99. Taylor Hicks&quot;Do I Make You Proud&quot; / &quot;Takin&#039; It To The Streets&quot; [CD-SINGLE]
I've never been
The one to raise my hand
That was not me
And now that's who I am
Because of you
I am standing tall
My heart is full
Of endless gratitude
You were the one
The one to guide me through
Now I can see
And I believe
It's only just beginning
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
Do I make you proud
Everybody needs to rise up
Everybody needs to be loved
To be loved
