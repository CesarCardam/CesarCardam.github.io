Just gimme di trees and mek we smoke it yo
(Smoke it yo)
It don't mek we please so don't provoke it yo
(Voke it yo)
We nuh need nuh speed so we nuh gon coke it yo
(Coke it yo)
Set we mind at ease we gotta take it slow
So when yuh see di S.P. floatin', don't provoke him
Cau di weed weh we smokin' need fi soakin'

And di best hygrade a Jamaican
When we a bun a weed we supportin' and promotin'
Lau di crack and di coke ting yeah we soakin'

Legalize it right now we wanna blaze one
Everyday, we be burnin' not concernin' what nobody wanna say

Some got gold and oil and diamonds all we got is Mary J
Legalize it, time you recognize it
This purple haze it mek mi crazy
Mek mi write new tune yeah dat's what pays me
But I'm not di only occupation

And it found on di grave of King Solomon
And it good fi di eye sight and di chest sight
And it give yuh nuff insight just gimme di light
