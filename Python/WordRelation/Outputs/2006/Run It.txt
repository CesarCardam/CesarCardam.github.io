They want to stay up
And party all night
So bring a friend.
Let me talk to you
Tell you how it is.
I was thinkin' when I saw that body
Gotta get shorty
Tell her what the young boy goin' do.
Damn them chicks with you
Gotta be okay
Babe pretty thick with a kick that's sick

They hop out and you hop in.
