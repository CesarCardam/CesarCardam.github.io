La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh
You know I never felt like this before
La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh
This feels like so unreal
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
I'm aggressive just one thought of closing up
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
Da very moment gone you know I miss you
I'm the question, and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close, boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help
S.O.S., please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y.O.U. are making this hard
I can't take it, see it don't feel right
S.O.S. please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y.O.U. are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night
This time, please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Just testing me, but still I'm losing it
This time, please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it
Just your presence, and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, and it's based on my vanity
My tummy's up in knots, as I see you, I get so hot
Common sense is out the door, can't seem to find a lot
Take a minute, you know inside you feel it right
Take me home, I put desire in your arms tonight
I'm out with you, ya got me head over heels
Boy, you keep me hanging on, the way you make me feel
S.O.S., please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y.O.U. are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night
This time, please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Just testing me, but still I'm losing it
This time, please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it
Boy, you know you got me feeling open
And, boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said, boy; I'm telling you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm going crazy over you, I'm begging
S.O.S., please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y.O.U. are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin', can't sleep at night
This time, please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Just testing me, but still I'm losing it
This time, please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it
La la la, la la la, la la, oh
Oh oh, la la la, la la la, la la, oh oh
