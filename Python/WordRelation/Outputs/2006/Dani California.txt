23. Red Hot Chili PeppersStadium Arcadium
Getting born in the state of Mississippi
Her papa was a copper, and her mama was a hippy
In Alabama she will swing a hammer
Price you got to pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than all
What in the world does your compliment take me for?
Black bandanna, sweet Louisiana
Robbing on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner
Rebel, and a stunner
Come to Mirawais saying baby, watcha gonna?
Looking down the barrel of a hot bell forty-five
Just another way to survive
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess
I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a lover
Baby, and a fighter
Should a seen it coming when I got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little low
That she was stealing another bread
I love my baby to death
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess
I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Who knew the hardest side of you?
Who knew the hardest time to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say
Pushed the fader
Gifted animator
One for the now
And eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man
Wasn't gunnin' for the quota
Down in the Badlands she was saving the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone to fade
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess
I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah, yeah
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess
I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah, yeah
