59. Young Dro Featuring T.I.Best Thang Smokin&#039;
[Chorus x 2]
Let me see you bounce right and left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Dro, I'm clean in this bitch
Now I'm finna shoulder lean in this bitch
Nigga, ball, carbon fifteen in this bitch
This Grand Hustle team of kings is gettin' rich
I lean and get lit, lima bean six
I take breath, the opposite of Primatine Mist
I ride twenty-six and let my nine scream 'flip'
Dro be watchin' Oprah, Mac, nine up in a clip
Triple black phantom nigga, nah, it ain't Tip
With Lucky Charm diamond, but, nah, it ain't Flip
K bounce
Okay, then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car charge, and I bet my motor clean
Suicide doors, Brown Rover look like poke 'n bean
E'rybody know me in the club 'cause they smokin' me, Dro
Hos scopin' me, ice come from Bo Bareeton
Hundred carats have 'em froze for an eon
Red, black, and white Chevy, now I'm ridin' Deion
Put them lights up in my rims, now I'm ridin' neon
Our cars look like crayon, hos know I'm the man though
I can shoulder lean
I dunno how to dance though
[Chorus x 2]
First I let my wheels spin, then I let my screen fall
Then I let my trunk beat at Greenbriar Mall, tall
And then I pimp a ho, take a bitch to Berlin
Bitch break niggaz, after that we fuck they girlfriend
My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind
Nigga, it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in
Pearl Bent', cockin' hammer, Arm & Hammer propaganda
Bitches think I'm pimpin' and leanin' in salamander sandals
Dirty South hot 'cause Atlanta show niggaz with ammo
We ride Phantom, holla shawty for grammar
Yep, now I be on TV, BET out the channel
Hood nigga from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana
I lay by my banana, dumpin' and punkin' monkeys
Don't nobody live with my mama but a bunch of junkies
Throw me the donkey, bitch, I ride glaze on the haze
Gator green Chevy, gator gut, alligator J's
[Chorus x 2]
Lean, lean
Lean, lean
Lean, lean
Lean, lean
Lean, lean
Lean, lean
Lean, lean
Lean, lean
Get ya shoulder, shawty
Lean, lean
Lean, lean
Lean, lean
Lean, lean
Lean, lean
Lean, lean
Lean, lean
Lean, lean
[Chorus]
