96. PinkI&#039;m Not Dead
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Stupid girl
(Woo)
Stupid girls
Stupid girls
[Chorus]
Maybe if I act like that
That guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girls (yeah)
I don't wanna be a stupid girl (uh-huh)
Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there
Laughing loud so all the little people stare
Looking for a daddy to pay for the champagne
(Droppin' names)
What happened to the dream of a girl president?
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of two or three
With their itsy-bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees
Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh where, oh where could they be?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus]
Maybe if I act like that
Flippin' my blond hair back (yeah)
Push up my bra like that
I don't wanna be a stupid girl
(Break it down now)
The disease is growing; it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it, and I'm going crazy
I cannot take any more
I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see (c'mon)
Disasters all around
(Disasters all around)
A world of despair
(A world of despair)
Your only concern
'Will it fuck up my hair?'
[Chorus]
Maybe if I act like that (uh-huh, uh-huh, do ya thing)
Flippin' my blond hair back (do ya thing)
Push up my bra like that
I don't wanna be a stupid girl (yeah, yeah, uh)
(Do ya thing, do ya thing, do ya thing, do ya thing, do ya, huh)
(I like this, like this, like this)
Pretty 'will-you-fuck-me' girl
Silly 'I'm-so-lucky' girl
Pull-my-hair-I'll-suck-it girl
Stupid girl!
Pretty 'will-you-fuck-me' girl
Silly 'I'm-so-lucky' girl
Pull-my-hair-I'll-suck-it girl
Stupid girl!
(Maybe if I act)
Maybe if I act like that
Flipping my blond hair back
(Maybe if I act)
Push up my bra like that
Stupid girl!
(Girl, girl, girl)
[Chorus]
(Stupid girl)
Maybe if I act like that
(Maybe if I act like that)
Flippin' my blond hair back
(Flipping my blond hair back)
Push up my bra like that
(Push up my bra like that)
I don't wanna be a stupid girl
(Stupid girl)
Maybe if I act like that
(Stupid girl)
Flipping my blond hair back
(Stupid girl)
Push up my bra like that
(Stupid girl)
Stupid girl
Stupid girl
(Stupid girl)
Stupid girl
(Stupid girl)
Stupid girl
(Stupid girl)
