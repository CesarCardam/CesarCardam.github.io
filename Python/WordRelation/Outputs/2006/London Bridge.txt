Oh, shit (oh, shit, oh, shit)
Oh, shit (oh, shit, oh, shit)
Oh, shit (oh, shit, oh, shit)
Are you ready for this?
Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit
Oh
It's me
Fergie
The P
Polow
Fergie ferg, what's up, baby?
When I come to the club, step aside (oh, shit)
Pop the seats, don't be hating me in the line (oh, shit)
VIP 'cause you know I gotta shine (oh, shit)
I'm Fergie Ferg, and me love you long time (oh, shit)
All my girls get down on the floor (oh, shit)
Back to back, drop it down real low (oh, shit)
I'm such a lady, but I'm dancing like a ho (oh, shit)
'Cause you know I don't give a fuck, so here we go (oh, shit)
How come every time you come around
My London, London bridge wanna go down?
Like London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like...
How come every time you come around
My London, London bridge wanna go down?
Like London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like...
The drinks start pouring
And my speech starts slurring
Everybody start looking real good
The gray goose got your girl feeling loose
Now I'm wishing that I didn't wear these shoes (I hate heels)
It like every time I get up on the dude
Paparazzi put my business in the news
Better get up out my face (oh, shit)
Before I turn around and spray your ass with mace (oh, shit)
My lips make you wanna have a taste (oh, shit)
You got that?
I've got the bass
How come every time you come around
My London, London bridge wanna go down?
Like London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like...
How come every time you come around
My London, London bridge wanna go down?
Like London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like...
Hey London, ATL, Cali collabo, Fergie and Polo
