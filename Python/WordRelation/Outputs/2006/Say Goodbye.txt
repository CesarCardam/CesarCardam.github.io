Look
We gotta talk
Dang, I know, I know
But it's, it's just some things I gotta get off chest, alright?
Yeah, woo, ooo, woo, ooo, woo, ooo
Listen
Baby, come here and sit down
Let's talk; I got alot to say
So I guess I'll start by sayin' that I love you
But you know this thing ain't been a walk in the park (for us)
I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I finish, yeah
And I don't want to see you cry
But I don't want to be the one to tell you a lie, so
How do you let go when you
You just don't know what's on
The other side of the door?
When you're walking out, talk about it, and
Everything I tried to remember to say
Just went out my head
So I'm a do the best I can to get you to understand
Cause I know!!
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
Cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me
I, I gotta, gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard, but we gotta do it
It's kind of killing me
Cause there's never a right time
A right time to say goodbye
Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I
Found myself asking, "Why? Why?"
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world
And I never thought I would see the day we'd grow apart
And I wanna know...
How do you let go when you
You just don't know what's on
The other side of the door?
When you're walking out, talk about
Girl, I hope you understand
What I'm tryna say
We just can't go on
Pretending that we get along
Girl, how you not gonna see that I'm hurt?
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
Cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me
I, I gotta, gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard, but we gotta do it
It's kind of killing me
Cause there's never a right time
A right time to say goodbye
Listen to your heart
Girl, you know
We should be apart, baby
I, I just can't do it
I, I just can't do it
Listen to your heart
Girl, you know
We should be apart, baby
I, I just can't do it
And sometimes it makes me wanna cry
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Do you hear me crying?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
Cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me
I, I gotta, gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard, but we gotta do it
It's kind of killing me
Cause there's never a right time
A right time to say goodbye
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
Cause if I don't, you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me
I, I gotta, gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go
Our separate ways
And I know it's hard, but we gotta do it
It's kind of killing me
Cause there's never a right time
A right time to say goodbye
