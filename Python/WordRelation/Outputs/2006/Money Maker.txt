You... you lookin' good in them jeans
I bet you look even better with me in between
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
But you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind
I got on my right side, pourin' some cups
My whole hood is to my left, and they ain't giving a fuck
So feel free to get lose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you was sayin' today
But don't forget about this feeling that I'm making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile high points you earn when we taking my jet
And how everywhere you turn, I'll be making you wet

Switch, switch, switch it from right to left and
Switch it till you running right out of breath and
Take a break until you ready again and
You can invite over as many friends as
Ya want to, but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you somethin' to bump to, hey!
Luda, I'm at the top of my game
You want my hands from the bottom to the top of your frame
And I just wanna take a lil' ride on your curves
And get erotic, giving your body just what it deserves and
Let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius, Yup!
Call me the Renaissance man
Get up, and I stay harder than a cinder block, man, hey!
I'm just a bedroom gangster
And I been meanin' to tell ya that I really must thank ya when ya

Please don't stop it until it hurt, girl
You, you been lookin' a little tipsy
So if you could jus' shake it a little this way

The original bread winna of DTP
And you the center of attention that's distracting the squad
'Cause everybody in the camp is like, oh my God, she could...
