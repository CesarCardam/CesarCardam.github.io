[Chorus]
I still love you babe
I'm still for you girl
I'll never leave you baby
Cause I realize I need you in my life
Girl it just ain't right
What we said last night
Cause I know we didn't mean it
You feel the love is gone
Cause we don't get along
But I can prove you wrong
Girl I swear
Cause every time I close my eyes I see you
And how I want to live my life with you
There is no one
You're all I need and all I want
The only one I'll ever love
[Chorus]
In this relationship we spend a lot of time
Now it would be wrong if everything was always fine
Girl, I know we've had our share of ups and downs
But it doesn't mean that we can't work this out
Oh baby girl, I care, yeah
You know I do
Cause every time I close my eyes I see you
And how I want to live my life with you
There is no one else
You're all I need and all I want
The only one I'll ever love
[Chorus]
No, oh girl, I know I need ya baby
Cause every time I close my eyes I see you
And how I want to live my life with you
There is no one else
You're all I want and all I need
The only one I'll ever love
[Chorus: x3]
