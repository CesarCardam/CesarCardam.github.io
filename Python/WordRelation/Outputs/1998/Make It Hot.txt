41. Nicole Featuring Missy "Misdemeanor" Elliott & Mochaalbum
[Featuring Missy Timbaland Mocha]
[Mocha]
But uh anyway
You could catch me any day
Sipping Hennessey
And my peeps get plenty way
But anyways to see that I hold this dough
Cats fake it
I made it
I told you so
Mocha Latte
we no play
stress free
sexy and Montego Bay
You know its a pity that
y'all look like idiots
Yo boo let me know when I should rip this cat
[Nicole Ray Verse 1]
My man he don't call me anymore
We don't even kiss
Am I his fool
What must I do
To keep him loving me
All this love I give
That ain't cool
1- I got what you want (got what you want)
I got what you need (got what you need)
Can I get another shot
This time Ima make it hot
(repeat x 2)
[Nicole Ray - Verse 2]
I call my man at the crib
He turned off his phone
Said to call him back
Why silly me
Why didn't I suspect
He was making love
To someone else
Boy you killin' me
[Repeat 1]
Oh yeah (x 4)
[Repeat 1]
[Missy Elliott]
I'm sitting on the side of the curb
With a pocket of herb
I don't know if y'all heard
But I'm high as a bird
I can fly like Kelly
I can glide like skates
Me with no Timbaland
Is like Puff with no Mase
Wait , hold up
Wait a minute, what you say
Back it up, give me space
Who that, Nicole Ray
By the way, DJ, better play all day
Make the whole world say Damn this sucker Ray
Yo yo yo
Yeah this be the jump
That's making everybody want to bop their heads
Haters, lovers, whatever
Nicole Ray
Timbaland
Maa-goo
Aaliyah
Ginuwine
Missy
Playa
[Repeat 1 (with Timbaland repeating Nicole Ray)]
