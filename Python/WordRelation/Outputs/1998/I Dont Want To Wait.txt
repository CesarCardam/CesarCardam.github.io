10. Paula Colealbum
So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
And see the peace in every eye
She had two babies
One was six months one was three
In the war of '44
Every telephone ring
Every heartbeat stinging
When thought it was God calling her
Oh would her son grow to know his father
[Chorus]
I don't want to wait
For our lives to be over
I want to know right now
What will it be
I don't want to wait
For our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be
He showed up all wet
On the rainy front step
Wearing shrapnel in his skin
And the war he saw
Lives inside him still
It's so hard to be gentle and warm
The years passed by and now
He has a granddaughter
I don't want to wait
For our lives to be over
I want to know right now
What will it be
I don't want to wait
For our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be
Oh so you look at me
From across the room
You're wearing your anguish again
Believe me I know the feeling
It sucks you into the jaws of anger
Oh, so breathe a little more deeply my love
All we have is this very moment
And I don't want to do what
His father and his father and his father did
I want to be here now
So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
And see the peace in every eye
I don't want to wait
For our lives to be over
I want to know right now
What will it be
I don't want to wait
For our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be
I don't want to wait
For our lives to be over
I want to know right now
What will it be
I don't want to wait
For our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be
Sorry
So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
And see the love in every eye
