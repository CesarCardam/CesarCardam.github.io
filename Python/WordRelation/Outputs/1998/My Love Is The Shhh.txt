[Chorus]
Boy you'll never find another love
As good as this
So you better represent
'cause my love is the Shhh
(The bomb baby, bomb baby)
[Chorus 2]
Girl you'll never find another love

How you got it going on
And how you'll keep me satisfied
Ooh, yeah
But actions speak louder than words
I must see what I've heard
Is it true or do you lie
'Cause I need somebody giving nothin'

In the middle of the night
I'll take a little trip downtown
I'll be the freak you need in your life

Let me work that body, baby
Let me work that body, baby
Let me work that body, baby

Girl you'll never
Like you baby
Baby, baby, ah

Nobody loves me better
