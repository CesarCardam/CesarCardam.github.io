02. Brandy & MonicaNever Say Never
The boy is mine, the boy is mine
The boy is mine, the boy is mine
The boy is mine
Excuse me can I please talk to you for a minute?
Uh huh sure you know you look kinda familiar.
Yeah you do to, but I just wanted to know do you know somebody named?
Oh you know his name.
Oh yeah definitely I know his name.
Well I just want to let you that he's mine.
Huh no no he's mine!
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
Think its time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man are you insane
But see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But your blind if you can't see
That his love is holding me
See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame
But maybe you misunderstood
'cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took (the boy is mine)
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know its me not you
And if you didn't know it's cause it's true
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is apart of my life
I know its killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture
Your the past I'm the future
Get away it's my time to shine
If you didn't know the boy is mine
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
You need to give it up (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Had about enough (had about enough)
It's not hard to see (he's mine! he's mine! he's mine! he's mine!)
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you (i'm so sorry you seem to be confused)
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine
You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart
He was my love right from the start
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
The boy is mine, not yours
But mine
Not yours
But mine
Not yours
But mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine!
