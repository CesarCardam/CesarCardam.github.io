She was of friend of mine
She left with my man
She lied, cheated
Took all I had
She was a friend of mine
She used what she knew
She lied, cheated
And left me confused
I feel so lost
Don't know why this has happened to me, um
My closet friend,
I never could have thought it could be
You were someone,
Someone I really thought I could trust
But my man, you laid
And I'm betrayed
She was of friend of mine
She left with my man
She lied, cheated
Took all I had
She was a friend of mine
She used what she knew
She lied, cheated
And left me confused
Thicker than blood
Wherever there was me there was you, um
My all was your all,
But that wasn't enough for you
You had to see,
And tired to walk a mile in my shoes
In my head, In my bed
Betrayed by my best friend
She was of friend of mine
She left with my man
She lied, cheated
Took all I had
She was a friend of mine
She used what she knew
She lied, cheated
And left me confused
I want to know why, why?
You were my friend, why?
I gave you all I had, why?
Everything, everything that you wanted, why?
You were my friend, why?
Oh! My sister, why?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, why?
