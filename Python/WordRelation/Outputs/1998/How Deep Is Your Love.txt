71. Dru Hill Featuring RedmanEnter The Dru
Hey mami you know that I like it when you call me papi
But it seems like that you be creeping
That you've been seeing another chico
And baby you know that he can't go down like me
And you know the nigga can't freak like me
So mami tell me one little thing
How deep is your love for me
How deep is your love for me
Tell me what it's gonna be
Now do you see your self fuckin
With a nigga like me
On the low though so your friends won't know see
How deep is your love for me
Tell me what it's gonna be
Now do you see your self fuckin
With a nigga like me
On the low though so your friends won't know see
Will I keep you mami
Puerto Rican I see the way you wiggle it
The way you move your body
He can't make it get wetter than me
But I bet he keep telling you he better than me
Ooh...you know that he can't go down like me
And you know he ain't no freak like me
So baby tell me one little thing
How deep is you love for me
How deep is your love for me
Tell me what it's gonna be
Now do you see your self fuckin
With a nigga like me
On the low though so your friends won't know see
Ay Dios mio
Te extrano mucho
Ven aque mi papi morenito
Y damelo duro
Damelo papi chulo
How deep is your love for me
Tell me what it's gonna be
Now do you see your self fuckin
With a nigga like me
On the low though so your friends won't know see
How deep is your love for me
Tell me what it's gonna be
Now do you see your self fuckin
With a nigga like me
On the low though so your friends won't know see
