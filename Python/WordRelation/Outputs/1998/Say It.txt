Oh-ohoh-ohoh
oh-ohoh-ohohoh
oh-ohoh-ohoh
Am I givin enough, is it all it sould be
When the water gets rough, will you still swim with me?
So afraid to come close, I know that it may be too soon
It may be too much, for you to consume
Chorus:
And I want to know if I can live inside your world
And I want to know if I can give it to you girl
You know that I want to say it,
You know that I need to say it,
You know that I'd love to say it,
My love just goes on and on and on
I give you all that you need, there's no better place you could be
And I know that in time, you'll believe me
So please hold out your hand, and let's exchange these golden bands
Cause I want you in my life, I want you to be my wife
(chorus)
My girl, is so special
I want to give it all to you, loving you on and on
My girl, is so special
I want to give it all to you, loving you on and on
You know that I want to say it,
you know that I need to say it,
you know that I'd love to say it,
My love just goes on and on and on
(repeat 1)
My love just goes on and on and on
