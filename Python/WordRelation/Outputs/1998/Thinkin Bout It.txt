And I got you thinkin' 'bout it
Thinkin' about it, thinking about it, thinking about it
Girl I think that I should let you know
That I'm gonna have to up and go
If you keep givin' it up and cutting up
And act too fast giving up the ass
I love you but I had enough
Do it again, it's gon' be your last
I can forgive but won't forget
The things you did you'll soon regret
Ever dissin' me 'cause this could be
