42. All SaintsAll Saints
A few questions that I need to know
How you could ever hurt me so
I need to know what I've done wrong
And how long it's been going on
Was it that I never paid enough attention
Or did I not give enough affection
Not only will your answers keep me sane
But I'll know never to make the same mistake again
You can tell me to my face
Or even on the phone
You can write it in a letter
Either way I've have to know
Did I never treat you right
Did I always start the fight
Either way I'm going out of my mind
All the answers to my questions I have to find
My head's spinning
Boy, I'm in a daze
I feel isolated
Don't want to communicate
I'll take a shower
I will scour
I will roam
Find peace of mind
The happy mind
I once owned, yeah
Flexing vocabulary runs right through me
The alphabet runs right from A to Z
Conversations, hesitations in my mind
You got my conscience asking questions that I can't find
I'm not crazy
I'm sure I ain't done nothin' wrong, no
I'm just waiting
'Cause I heard that this feeling won't last that long
[Chorus:]
Never ever have I ever felt so low
When you gonna take me out of this black hole
Never ever have I ever felt so sad
The way I'm feeling, yeah, you got me feeling really bad
Never ever have I had to find
I've had to dig a way to find my own piece of mind
I've never ever had my conscience to fight
The way I'm feeling, yeah, it just don't feel right
[Chorus]
I'll keep searching
Deep within my soul
For all the answers
Don't want to hurt no more
I need peace
Gotta feel at ease
Need to be free from pain
Go insane
My heart aches, yeah
Sometimes vocabulary runs through my head
The alphabet runs right from A to Z
Conversations, hesitations in my mind
You got my conscience asking questions that I can't find
I'm not crazy
I'm sure I ain't done nothing wrong
Now I'm just waiting
'Cause I heard that this feeling won't last that long
[Chorus x4]
You can tell me to my face
You can tell me on the phone
Ooh, you can write it in a letter, babe
'Cause I really need to know
You can tell me to my face
You can tell me on the phone
Ooh, you can write it in a letter, babe
'Cause I really need to know
You can write it in a letter, babe
You can write it in a letter, babe
