When I'm done with thinking then I'm done with you.
When I'm done with crying then I'm done with you.
When I feel so tired then I'm done with you.
Everybody feels this way sometimes everybody feels this way
And I do.
You can't hear it but I do.
You can't hear it but I do.
You're trying to convince me that what I've done's not right.
I get so frustrated I stay up every night.
You ask me for an answer and I'm so tired and I'm up in the air.
Everybody feels this way sometimes, everybody feels this way
And I do.
You can't hear it, but I do.
You can't hear it, but I'm feeling this way just because you say
I will be ignored.
I will be denied.
I could be erased.
I could be brushed aside
I will get scared, and I will get shoved down,
But I feel like I do because you push me around.
I'm starting to ignore you, I've doubted you so long.
I'm tired of overthinking, I know you don't belong.
Now I'm asking questions - no one pushes me around.
Everybody feels this way sometimes, everybody feels this way -
And I do.
You can't hear it, but I do.
You don't seem angry, but I do.
I do.
