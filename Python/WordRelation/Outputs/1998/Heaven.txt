Ohhh heaven oh heaven can't you help me?
First time I saw you girl
You turned me upside-down
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
My head is spinning round
I got to find a way
To get with you somehow
Girl I'm so crazy for you
You know I want you now
And every minute of every single day
I'm dreaming of how it could be
And every night before I go to sleep I'm praying
That soon you'll be here with me
Heaven heaven oh heaven can't you help me?
I looked in her eyes now she's all I see
Heaven oh heaven can't you help me?
I'm down on my knees please help me
Can't fall asleep tonight I don't what to do
I hold my pillow but I wanna be holding you
And when I close my eyes
I always see your face
I know my happiness is only a kiss away
And every hour here in the dark
Every beat of my lonely heart
Tells me that I need to be with you
Heaven oh heaven what can I do?
Heaven heaven oh heaven can't you help me?
I'm giving my love for eternity
Heaven oh heaven can't you help me?
I'm down on my knees please help me
Girl I'd give anything
If you were here with me
Give you anything you want
And anything you need
I never thought that I, could feel the way I do
But now I wanna spend the rest of my life with you
And everyday that we are apart
I'm saving this love here in my heart
And every night before I go to sleep
I'm praying that soon you'll be here with me
Heaven heaven oh heaven can't you help me?
I looked in her eyes now she's all I see
Heaven oh heaven can't you help me?
I'm down on my knees please help me
Heaven...
