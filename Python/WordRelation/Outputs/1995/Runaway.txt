29. Janet JacksonThe Best
I've seen the world, been to many places
Made lots of friends, many different races
I've had such fun around the world it's true
African skies with a Nairobi mood, ooh
I fell asleep in Tuscany and dreamed
The one thing missing was you
Runaway with me my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runaway with me my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I woke up with an Australian breeze
And danced the dance with Aborigines
Oh under the moon glow down in Mexico I dreamed
One thing was missing that's you
Runaway with me my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Runaway with me my love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We'll sail the waters of many colours
We won't need a compass, love will guide our way
Don't need nobody, as long as we got each other
No need to hurry, we've got everyday
I wanna share the world with you, you see
Spring time in Paris feels so good to me
Oh this is for me reality
So please make all my wishes come true
Runaway with me my love,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I just know we'll have a good time, ooh
And I just know we'll have a good time, ah
And I just know we'll have a good time
And I just know we'll have a good time
And I just know we'll have a good time
And I just know we'll have a good time, yeah
