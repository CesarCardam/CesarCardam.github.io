I don't wanna see you ever sad
And ev'rything that I've got, you can have.
When it's all too much
You need some human touch
To see it's really not so bad.
Did you call on ev'ry saint you know,
But still you feel like you're on you own?
Can you see through your tears?
I will always be here.
You're not out there, baby all alone.
Hold on.
Do you feel a little stronger?
Hold on to me.
Yeah, and I said, hold on.
Ev'rything's gonna be alright,
Just hold on to me tonight.
Anything that hurts you, hurts me too,
And I'm not gonna let your world turn blue.
Will you take my hand and feel how close I am?
There ain't nothing I won't do for you.
Hold on.
Do you feel a little stronger?
Hold on to me.
Yeah, and I said, hold on.
Ev'rything's gonna be alright,
Just hold on to me tonight.
I know the world can drive you to your knees.
When you need to cry, baby, cry to me, yeah.
Yeah, now hold on.
Do you feel a little stronger?
Hold on to me.
Yeah. I said hold on.
Ev'rything's gonna be alright,
Just hold on to me tonight.
