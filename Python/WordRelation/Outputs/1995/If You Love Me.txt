34. BrownstoneFrom The Bottom Up
Ooh yeah, yoo hoo
I don't want to rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
I want a love that is based on truth not just dare
You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine in the light and the dark
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it
I don't want to rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
I want a love that is based on truth not just dare
You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine in the light and the dark
I don't want to rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
I want a love that is based on truth not just dare
I don't want to rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
I want a love that is based on truth not just dare
I don't want to rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
I want a love that is based on truth not just dare
You see now actions speak louder than words
So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul
I don't want a love who will come here and go
Oh I, oh I, I want to touch you baby
And spread my love all around you, honey
And if you come, you gotta show, baby
True love to share
Ooh yeah, my sweet baby
