He might be doing you
But he's thinkin' about me
So lay that finger on another lover
And go find another brother
I know he's my man
He's holding my hand
It feels good when he calls my name
Don't you wish you had the same
Feeling disgust workin' yo' stuff
Till he thinks about mine
Now he's feeling real high
You ask why
Cause he's mine
Tell you something that just ain't cool
Never fall in love with a man who don't love you
I wouldn't waste my time telling you something wrong
You been with him one night and now he's coming home
He's mine
You may have had him once
But I got him all the time
He's mine
You may have had him once
But I got him all the time
He's mine
You may have had him once
But I got him all the time
You went out on a date
You wasn't out too late
He took you to a room
And you gave it up too soon
Played you like a trick
Cause you let him hit
Now he's coming home to a lover that is strong
I got all his love baby don't try to take it
You wanted a piece
You were mistaken
Cause he belongs to me
Baby can't you see
I'll tell you something that just ain't cool
Never fall in love with a man who don't love you
I wouldn't waste my time telling you something wrong
You been with him one night, now he's coming home
He's mine
You may have had him once
But I got him all the time
We don't have time playing these games
You had him once but it's me on his mind
No need to cry, go dry your eyes
Get over it, it was only for one night
He's mine
You may have had him once
But I got him all the time
