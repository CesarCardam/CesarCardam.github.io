25. Soul For Realalbum
My love do you ever dream of
Candy coated rain drops
You're the same my candy rain
Have you ever love someone so much
You thought you'd die
Giving so much of yourself
It's seem the only way tell me
What you want and I
(And I)
Will give it to you
(You, you)
Cause you are
My love do you ever dream of
Candy coated rain drops
You're the same my candy rain
My love did you ever dream that it could be so right
I never thought that I would find
All that I need in life
All I want, all I need
Now I know, I know
I found it in you
(I found it in you)
Cause you are
