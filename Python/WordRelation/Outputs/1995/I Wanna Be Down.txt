I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl that you could be down for
'Cause when I look at you
I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should
Make a move on
And if I don't let you know
Then I won't be for real
I could be wrong but I feel
Like something could be going on
The more I see you
The more that it becomes so true
There ain't no other for me it's only you
I want to be down
With what you're going through
I want to be down down
I want to be down with you down with you
No matter the time of day or night
It's true I want to be down
I know anybody's gonna be lonely
Without the reason they got someone
To care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact then I'll be more
Than you ever could dream of
If all you need is my time
That I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my loving to you only, baby
I want to stay by your side
Be there to cool you out
And let you know everything will be alright
