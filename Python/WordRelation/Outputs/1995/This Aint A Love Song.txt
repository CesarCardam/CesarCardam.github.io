70. Bon JoviThese Days
I should have seen it coming when the roses died
should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said goodnight
You really meant goodbye
And baby, ain't it funny, how you never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees when you think you're standing tall
but only fools are 'know-it-alls' and I played that fool for you
I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby
If the love that I got for you's gone, if the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind. I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at The Masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
You and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us baby
Now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving, oh
If the love that I got for you's gone, if the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong is the reason that I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong, this ain't a love song
I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you, baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby
