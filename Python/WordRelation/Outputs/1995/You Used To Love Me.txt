79. Faith Evansalbum
I remember the way you used to love me.
I remember the days you used to love me.
You don't appreciate the time I put into this love affair of us, baby.
I couldn't let you walk around thinking it's alright to let me down.
I remember the way you used to love me.
I remember the days you used to love me.
I gave you al my precious love and anything you wanted from me.
You didn't hear me calling out, calling for your warm affection
after all this time.
You can't deny what I'm feeling is real and I stood right by your side,
went through all the hurt and pain.
Then you turned and walked away.
I remember the way you used to love me.
I remember the days you used to love me.
Yeah, oh. Can't give up all the ways you used to give it to me, give it to me.
What I'm feeling is so real.
I remember the way you used to love me.
I remember the days you used to love me.
You didn't hear me calling out, and that's not what love's about, no, no.
I remember .
You used to love me ev'ry day, now your love has gone away.
I remember, I remember.
