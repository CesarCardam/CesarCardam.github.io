[Chorus]
(Constantly) I've got you on my mind
(Constantly) And not just all the time
I think about you
(Constantly) If you only knew
I'm crazy for you
I think about you all the time
Constantly you're on my mind
At night I try
To close my eyes
But I, I can't get much sleep
You're always on my mind
You look so fine
I often pretend
That your my girl
Or at least my friend
If you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl don't you know
I long to be with you
Every single way of every single day
I start drifting away
And I think of you
[Chorus]
I practice my words
And I build up the nerve
But uh
Words disappear whenever you are near
I catch your eye
Time after time
Is love in the air
Or is it all in my mind
If you could read my mind
The only thing you'd find is you
Girl don't you know
I long to be with you
Every single way of every single day
I start drifting away
And I think of you
[Chorus: x2]
Constantly your on my mind
At night, I try, to close my eyes, my eyes
But I, I can't sleep my freak
Romeo's gonna meet you in the sand at the beach
On my mind you're so fine
(I often pretend you're my baby, pretend you're my baby)
Or at least my friend, yeah
[Chorus]
I practice my words, oh
I build up the nerve, oh
But words dissapear, whenever you're
Whenever you're near
I catch your eyes
Time after time
Is love in he air
Or is it in my mind baby
[Chorus]
