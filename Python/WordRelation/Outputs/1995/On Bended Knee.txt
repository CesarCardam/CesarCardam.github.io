Darlin' I can't explain, where did we lose our way
Girl, it's drivin' me insane and I know
I just need one more chance to prove my love to you
If you come back to me I guarantee that I'll never let you go.
can we go back to the days our love was strong.
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong.
Can somebody tell me how you get things back the way it used to be
Oh God give me the reason, I'm down on bended knees
I'll never walk again until you come back to me I'm down on bended knees.

Gonna swallow my pride, say I'm sorry,
stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me
I want a new life and I want it with you
If you feel the same don't ever let it go.
You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It can heal all things we won't hurt anymore
No, I don't believe our loves terminal.
I'm down on my knees, begging you please come home.

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
seems like eternity
I'm begging yo, begging you, come back to me
Darlin' I can't explain, where did we lose our way
Girl, it's drivin' me insane and I know
I just need one more chance to prove my love to you
If you come back to me I guarantee that I'll never let you go.
