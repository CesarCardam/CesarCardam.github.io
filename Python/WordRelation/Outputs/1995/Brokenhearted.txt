I'm young but I'm wise
Enough to know that you
Don't fall in love over night
That's why I thought if I
Took my time that everything
In love would be right
But as soon as I closed my eyes
I was saying to love Goodbye
But I guess I'm
Lonely brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over
No more empty conversation
Next time I will be totally sure
Don't want the pain of falling
In and out of love
It's more than my poor heart should endure
So I listen to all the advice
And remember each time I cry
But I guess I'm
Lonely brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over
Oh Ya
Wow Ya
I listen to all the advice
And remember each time I cry
Only brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over
Lonely brokenhearted
Life's not over
I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over [Repeats]
