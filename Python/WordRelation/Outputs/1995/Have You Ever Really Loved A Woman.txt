16. Bryan Adams18 Til I Die
To really love a woman
To understand her you gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought see every dream
N' give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
Ya know ya really love a woman
When you love a woman you tell her
That she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody to tell her
That it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really really ever loved a woman?
To really love a woman
Let her hold you
Til ya know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her really taste her
'Til you can feel her in your blood
N' when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
Ya know ya really love a woman
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody to tell her
That you'll always be together
So tell me have you ever really
Really really ever loved a woman?
