If I could be you and you could be me for just one hour
If we could finda way to get inside each others mind
If you could see you through my eyes instead of your ego
I believe you'd be surprised to see that you'd been blind
Walk a mile in why shoes, walk a mile in my shoes
Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse, walk a mile in my shoes
Well, your whole world around you is just a reflection
And the law of common says you're gonna reap just what you sow
[spoken:] Yes, you will
So unless you've lived a life of total perfection
Mm-mm, you'd better be careful of evey stone that you should throw
[spoken] Yeah, yeah
Yet we spend the day throwin' stones at one another
'Cause I don't think or wear my hair the same way you do
Well, I may be common people but I'm your brother
And when you strike out and try to hurt me it's a-hurtin' you
[spoken] Lord, have mercy
Walk a mile in my shoes, walk a mile in my shoes
Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse, walk a mile in my shoes
There are people on reservations and out in the ghettos
And brother, there, but for the grace of God, go you and I
[spoken] Yeah, yeah
If I only had the wings of little angels don'tcha you know I'd fly
To the top of the mountain andthen I'd cry?
[spoken] Yeah
Walk a mile in my shoes, walk a mile in my shoes
Oh, before you abuse, crticize and accuse, walk a mile in my shoes
[spoken] Yeah
Walk a mile in my shoes, walk a mile in my shoes
Hey, before you abuse, criticize and accuse, walk a mile in my shoes.
