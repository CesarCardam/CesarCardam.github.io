100. Aretha FranklinRespect
I love you, and I love you and I love you too
Baby will you call me the moment you get there
Hey baby, I love you, and I love you too, and I love you
Baby will you call me the moment you get there, yeah
Yeah, baby
My dearest, my dearest of all darlings
I know, I know, I know, I know we've got to part
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
It really doesn't hurt me that bad, yeah
Because you are taking me with you
And I'm keeping you right here in my arms
It's all because I love you, ooh hoo, and I love you, and I love you too
Baby will you call me the moment you get there
Baby, will you do that, will you do that for me now
Oh, call me, call me the hour, call me the minute, second that you get there
Oh, call me, call me, call me, call me, call me, call me, baby
Baby, call me the hour, call me the moment you get there
Don't forget about me, baby, I love you
Baby, call me the moment you get there
Call me, baby, call me the hour, call me the minute, the moment, the second
Yeah, call me baby, call me the minute, the second, the moment, the hour
Don't forget, don't forget, don't forget about me, baby
