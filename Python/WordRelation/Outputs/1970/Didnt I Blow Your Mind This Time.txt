I gave my heart and soul to you, girl
Didn't I do it baby, didn't I do it baby?
Gave you the love you never knew, girl
Didn't I do it baby, didn't I do it baby?
I've tried so many times and that's no lie
It seems to make you laugh each time I cry
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
Listen
I thought that heart of yours was true, girl
Now didn't I think it baby, didn't I think it baby?
But this time I'm really leavin' you, girl
Hope you know it baby, hope you know it baby
Ten times or more, yes, I've walked out that door
Get this into your head, there'll be no more
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
Didn't I do it baby, didn't I do it baby?
Didn't I do it baby, didn't I do it baby?
Ten times or more, yes, I've walked out that door
Get this into your head, there'll be no more
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
I got to live you, baby
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
