80. Joe CockerLong Voyage Home
Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
I ain't got time to take no fast train
Oh, the lonely days are gone
I'm coming home
Oh, my baby she wrote me a letter
I don't care how much money I got to spend
I won't find my way, way back home again
Oh the lonely days are gone
I'm coming home
Yeah my baby, she wrote me a letter
Well she wrote me the letter
Said that she couldn't live without me no more
Listen to me mister please don't you ever
My baby once more
Anyway
I don't care how much I've gotta spend
I'm gonna find my way, gonna find my way back home again
Oh, the lonely days are gone
I'm coming home, yeah
Well my baby she wrote me a letter
Yeah
Well she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Oh listen to me mister don't jump the rail
For my baby once more
Anyway
Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
I ain't got time to take no fast train
Oh, the lonely days are gone
I'm coming home
Yeah, my baby she wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
My baby wrote me a letter
