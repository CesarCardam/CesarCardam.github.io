45. Jaggerzalbum
Hey girl, I bet you
There's someone out to get you
You'll find him anywhere
On a bus, in a bar, in a grocery store
He'll say, "Excuse me
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?"
Rap, rap, rap
They call him the Rapper
Rap, rap, rap
You know what he's after
So, he starts his rappin'
Hopin' something will happen
He'll say he needs you
A companion, a girl he can talk to
He's made up his mind
He needs someone to sock it to
Rap, rap, rap
They call him the Rapper
Rap, rap, rap
You know what he's after
He's made an impression
So he makes a suggestion
"Come up to my place
For some coffee or tea or me"
He's got you where he wants you
Girl, you've gotta face reality
Rap, rap, rap
They call him the Rapper
Rap, rap, rap
You know what he's after
Rap, rap, rap
They call him the Rapper
