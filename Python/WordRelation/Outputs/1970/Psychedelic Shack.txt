People, let me tell you 'bout a place I know, to get in it don't take much dough
Where you can really do your thing, oh yeah
It's got a neon sigh outside that says
Come in and take a look at your mind
You'll be surprised what you might find
Strobe lights flashing from sun up to sun down
People gather there from all parts of town
Right around the corner, you know it's just across the track
People I'm talking abut the psychedelic shack
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at
Psychedelic shack, that's where it's at

You can have your fortune told, you can learn the meaning of soul
There ain't no such a thing as time
Incense in the air, peace signs painted everywhere
I guarantee you this place will blow your mind
They got music so high you can't get over it
So low you can't get under it
Right around the corner, you know it's just across the track

You might see anybody there, yeah
Bearskin rugs, tails and minks
It don't really matter what you wear
Take off your shoes, sit on the floor
Join in and be what you wanna be, don't you know it's
Right around the corner, you know it's just across the track

They got a cat there shoutin' the blues, talkin' 'bout payin' some dues
People walkin' round reciting poetry, yeah
Screaming guitars and a thousand colored lights
People, I'm telling you this place is really out of sight
You can have your fortune told, you can learn the meaning of soul
I can tell you the place will blow your mind, don't you know it's
Right around the corner, you know it's just across the track
