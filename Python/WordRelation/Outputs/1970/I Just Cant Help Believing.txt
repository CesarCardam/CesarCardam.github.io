75. B.J. Thomasalbum
I just can't help believin'
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty mornin'
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes
And I just can't help believin'
When she's lyin' close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sighs
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay for more than just a day
I just can't help believin'
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
That my fingers fold around it like a glove
And I just can't help believin'
When she's whisperin' her magic
And her tears are shinin' honey sweet with love
This time the girl is gonna stay (This time the girl is gonna stay)
This time the girl is gonna stay for more than just a day
For more than just a day
(Just can't help believin')
