10. Freda Paynealbum
Now that you've gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold,
Band of gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me
You took me from the shelter of my mother
I have never known or loved another
We kissed after taking vows
That nigh on our honeymoon
We stayed in separate rooms
I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom,
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before
Now that you've gone
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold,
Band of gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me
Don't you know that I wait
In the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom,
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before
Since you've been gone,
All that's left is a band of gold
All that's left of the dreams I hold,
Band of gold
And the memories of what love could be
If you were still here with me
I wait in the darkness of my lonely room
Filled with sadness, filled with gloom,
Hoping soon
That you'll walk back through that door
And love me like you tried before
