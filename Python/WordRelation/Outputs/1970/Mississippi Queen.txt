Mississippi Queen, You know what I mean
Mississippi Queen, She taught me everything
Went down around Vicksburg, around Louisiana way
Where lived the Cajun Lady, aboard the Mississippi Queen
You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were gettin' their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine
Mississippi Queen, If you know what I mean
Mississippi Queen, She taught me everything
This lady she asked me, if I would be her man
You know that I told her, I'd do what I can
To keep her lookin' pretty, buy her dresses that shine
While the rest of them dudes were makin' their friends
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was loosin' mine
You know she was a dancer, she moved better on wine
While the rest of them dudes were gettin' their kicks
Boy, I beg your pardon, I was gettin' mine
Yeah, Mississippi Queen
