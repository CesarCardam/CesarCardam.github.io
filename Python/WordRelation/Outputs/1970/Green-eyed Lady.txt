Green eyed lady, lovely lady
Strolling slowly towards the sun
Green eyed lady, ocean lady
Soothing every raging wave that comes
Green eyed lady, passion's lady
Dressed in love, she lives for life to be
Green eyed lady feels like I never see
Setting sons and lonely lovers free
Green eyed lady, windswept lady
Moves the night the waves the sand
Green eyed lady, ocean lady
Child of nature, friend of man
Green eyed lady, passion's lady
Dressed in love, she lives for life to be
Green eyed lady feels like I never see
Setting sons and lonely lovers free
