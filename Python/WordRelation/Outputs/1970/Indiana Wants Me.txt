Indiana Wants Me, Lord, I can't go back there.
Indiana Wants Me, Lord, I can't go back there,
I wish I had you to talk to.
If a man ever needed dyin', he did,
No one had the right to say what he said about you,
And it's so cold and lonely here without you.
Out there the law's a comin',
I'm gettin' so tired of runnin'
Indiana Wants Me, Lord, I can't go back there
Indiana Wants Me, Lord, I can't go back there.
I wish I had you to talk to.
It hurts to see the man that I've become,
And to know I'll never see the morning sunshine on the land,
I'll never see your smiling face or touch your hand.
If just once more I could see you, our home and our little baby.
Indiana Wants Me, Lord, I can't go back there
Indiana Wants Me, Lord, I can't go back there.
I wish I had you to talk to.
I hope this letter finds its way to you,
Forgive me, love, for the shame I put you through and all the tears,
Hang on, love, to the mem'ries of those happy years.
Red lights are flashin' around me
Yeah, love it looks like they found me.
