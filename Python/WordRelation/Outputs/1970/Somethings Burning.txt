38. Kenny Rogers & The First Edition42 Ultimate Hits
You lie in gentle sleep beside me
I hear your warm and rhythmic breathing
I take your hand and hold it tightly
Listen
Can you not hear our young hearts beating
I kiss the sleep from your eyes
Your smile is sweeter than the morning
Here it comes
Can't you feel it Baby
Can't you feel it
Here comes
Feel it
Feel it
Fire
Fire
Something's Burning
Something's Burning
Something's Burning
Something's Burning I think it's love
I believe it's love
And now the sun is burning brightly
We lie in love so close together
I get the feeling deep inside me
My love for you will burn forever
I cup my hands to touch your face
Once again I feel your fire
Here it comes
Can't you feel it Baby
Can't you feel it
Here comes
Feel it
Feel it
Fire
Fire
Something's Burning
Something's Burning
Something's Burning
Something's Burning I think it's love
I believe it's love
I believe it's love
I believe it's love
I believe it's love
I believe it's love
