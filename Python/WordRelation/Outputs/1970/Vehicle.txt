85. Ides Of MarchVehicle
Hey well
I'm a friendly stranger in a black sedan
Won't you hop inside my car.
I got pictures, got candy
I'm a lovable man
And I can take you to the nearest star.
I'm your vehicle baby
I'll take you anywhere you want to go.
I'm your vehicle woman
But I'm not sure you know
That I love ya
I need ya
I want ya,
Got to have you child,
Great God in heaven you know I love you.
Well if you want to be a movie star
I'll get a ticket to Hollywood.
But if you want to stay just the way you are
You know I think you really should.
I'm your vehicle baby
I'll take you anywhere you want to go.
I'm your vehicle woman
But I'm not sure you know
That I love ya
I need ya
I want ya,
Got to have you child,
Great God in heaven you know I love you.

And I'm your vehicle babe.
