59. ChicagoGreatest Hits (Chicago IX)
Children play in the park, they don't know
I'm alone in the dark, even though
Time and time again I see your face smiling inside
I'm so happy (oh, oh)
That you love me (oh, oh)
Life is lovely (woah)
When you're near me
Tell me you will stay
Make me smile
Living life is just a game so they say
All the games we used to play fade away
We may now enjoy the dreams we shared so long ago
Oh my darling
Got to have you
Feel the magic
When I hold you
Cry sweet tears of joy
Touch the sky
Now I need you (oh, yeah)
More than ever (oh, yeah)
No more crying (ohh, ohh)
We're together
Tell me you will stay
Make me smile
