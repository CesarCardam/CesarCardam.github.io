37. Brook BentonRainy Night in Georgia: The Complete Reprise &amp; Cotillion Singles A&#039;s &amp; B&#039;s
Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
"It's all right"
A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night
A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing
I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right
A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
