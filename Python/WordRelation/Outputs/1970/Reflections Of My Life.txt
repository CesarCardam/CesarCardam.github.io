43. Marmaladealbum
The changing of sunlight to moonlight
Reflections of my life
Oh how they fill my eyes
[Repeat: x 2]
The greetings of people in trouble
Reflections of my life
Oh how they fill my eyes
[Chorus]
Oh my sorrows
Sad tomorrows
Take me back to my own home
[Chorus: x 2]
Oh my crying (Oh my crying)
Feel I'm dying, dying
Take me back
to my own home
The changing of sunlight to moonlight
Reflections of my life
Oh how they fill my eyes
I'm changing, arranging,
I'm changing,
I'm changing everything
Everything around me
The changing of sunlight to moonlight
Reflections of my life
Oh how they fill my eyes
The world is
a bad place
A bad place
A terrible place to live
Oh but I don't want to die ...
[Chorus: x 2]
