51. Tyrone DavisTurn Back the Hands of Time
Oh darling I'm so lonely without you
Can't sleep at night always think about you
But if I had the chance to start all over
I would be wishing today on a four leaf clover
And leaving you with the last thing on my mind
If I could turn back the hands of time
Oh darling I can't hold out much longer
Oh the pain's so deep and the hurt is getting stronger
But if I had just one more try
I would be yours, yours alone until the day I die
and we would have a love so divine
If I could turn back the hands of time
Oh darling please, please let me come back home
Your love has been so good to me baby
And I just relied without it
I can't go on and you're the other half
That makes my life complete
If I had one more chance we'd have a love so sweet
