61. ChicagoChicago Box (Bonus DVD)
Waiting for the break of day
Searching for something to say
Dancing lights against the sky
Giving up I close my eyes
Should have tried to do some more
Twenty five or six to four, oh yeah
Feeling like I ought to sleep
Spinning room is sinking deep
Searching for something to say
Waiting for the break of day, ohh
Twenty five or six to four
Twenty five or six to four
