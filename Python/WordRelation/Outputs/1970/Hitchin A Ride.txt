14. Vanity Fairalbum
A thumb goes up, a car goes by
It's nearly 1 a.m. and here am I
Hitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride
Gotta get me home by the morning light
I got no fare to ride a train
I'm nearly drowin' in the pouring rain
Hitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride
Gotta get me home to my baby's side
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Long distance call I got today
She sounded lonely so I'm on my way
Hitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride
Gotta get me home, keep her satisfied
instrumental break
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
A thumb goes up, a car goes by
Oh, won't somebody stop and help a guy?
Hitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride
Been away too long from my baby's side
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
