23. Melanie & The Edwin Hawkins SingersCandles in the Rain/Leftover Wine
Lay down lay down, let it all down
Let your white birds smile up at the
Ones who stand and frown
Lay down lay down, let it all down
Let your white birds smile up at the
Ones who stand and frown
We were so close, there was no room
We bled inside each others wounds
We all had caught the same disease
And we all sang the songs of peace
chorus
So raise the candles high cause if you
Don't we could stay black against the night
Oh raise them higher again and if you
Do we could stay dry against the rain
chorus
We were so close, there was no room
We bled inside each others wounds
We all had caught the same disease
And we all sang the songs of peace
Some came to sing, some came to pray
Some came to keep the dark away
So raise the candles high
Cause if you don't we could stay
Black against the sky
Oh oh raise them higher again
And if you do we could stay dry against the rain
chorus
