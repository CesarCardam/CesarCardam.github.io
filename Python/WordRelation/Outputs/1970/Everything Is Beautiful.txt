12. Ray StevensRay Stevens Box Set
Jesus loves the little children
All the children of the world
Whether yellow, black and white
They are precious in his sight
Jesus loves the little children of the world
Everything is beautiful in it's own way
Like a starry summer night
Or a snow covered winter's day
And everybody's beautiful in their own way
Under God's Heaven
The world's gonna find a way
There is none so blind
As He who will not see
We must not close our minds
We must let our thoughts be free
For every hour that passes by
You know the world gets a little bit older
It's time to realize that beauty lies
In the eyes of the beholder
And everything is beautiful in it's own way
Like a starry summer night
Or a snow covered winter's day,
Everybody's beautiful in their own way
Under God's Heaven
The world's gonna find a way
We shouldn't care about the length of His hair
Of the color of His skin
Don't worry about what shows from without
But the love that lives within
And we're gonna get it all together now
Everythings gonna work out fine
Just take a little time to the look on the good side my friend
And straighten it out in your mind
And everything is beautiful in it's own way
Like a starry summer night
Or a snow covered winter's day,
Everybody's beautiful in their own way
Under God's Heaven
The world's gonna find a way,
And everything is beautiful in it's own way
Like a starry summer night
On a snow covered winter's day
