Every man wants a woman where him an her can just go hang
Just the two of them alone, kick back, doing their own thang
And every man wants a woman that can always keep him in the mood
And I'm that kind of girl so this is what I tell my dude
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the XS-CAPE beat
Just kick it, just kick it
Just kick it, just kick it
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the XS-CAPE beat
Just kick it, just kick it
Just kick it, just kick it
Every man wants a woman
That can cook him up a good meal
A woman he can treat like his homie
And take her out on the ave and just chill
And every man wants a woman
That ain't good for just lying on her back
And I'm that kind of woman
So before me and my man get in the sack
I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet (kick off your shoes)
Party on down to the XS-CAPE beat
Just kick it, just kick it
Just kick it
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the XS-CAPE beat
Just kick it, just kick it
Just kick it
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the XS-CAPE beat
Just kick it, just kick it
Just kick it
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the XS-CAPE beat
Just kick it, just kick it
Just kick it
This is for the, this is for the, strictly for the
This is for the, this is for the, the real
This is for the, this is for the, strictly for the
This is for the, this is for the, the real
This is for the, this is for the, strictly for the
This is for the, this is for the, the real
This is for the, this is for the, strictly for the
This is for the, this is for the, the real
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the XS-CAPE beat
Just kick it, just kick it
Just kick it
Kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Party on down to the XS-CAPE beat
Just kick it, just kick it
Just kick it
