20. SWVThe Best Of SWV
Boy, there you go
You're telling me that you love me
But boy you know
That you belong to another girl who loves you
You are so fine, (so fine, so fine)
You blow my mind
(Things you do) with the things you do to me
(She sees) She's not blind, she's not blind
Things you do for me, but I know
[Chorus]
I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Boy, you got me so confused
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Friends ask how could
I give myself
To one who belongs to someone else. They just don't know
Your love's so good
That they would want it for themselves
Anyone can see..
You are so fine, (so fine, so fine)
You blow my mind
(Things you do) with the things you do to me
(She sees) She's not blind, she's not blind
Things you do for me, but I know
[Chorus: x2]
[Repeat 3x]
You're not, you're not mine
Ooh, what am I supposed to do
[Chorus]
