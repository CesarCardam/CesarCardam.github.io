76. Restless Heartalbum
The road I have traveled on
Is paved with good intentions
And littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true
When all of my hopes were dyin'
Her love kept me tryin'
She does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through
When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear (her)
She tries to hide
All the fear she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries
She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side
I don't know how she takes it
Just once I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her lovin' eyes
