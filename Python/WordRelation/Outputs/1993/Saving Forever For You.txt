I've never been so sure about anything before
But this lovin' feeling's
Gonna be a feeling
I feel forever more.
Looking in your eyes
Tomorrow's all I see.
As long as there's forever, baby
I will always be
Saving forever for you baby
You are the only one
I'd ever give forever to.
Love for a lifetime won't do baby.
Want to always stay together
So I'm saving forever
For you
You'll be my world as long as there's a world turning round.
And you'll be my heaven, baby
Till the heavens all come falling down.
Look inside my heart
Love is all you'll see
I'm loving you forever, baby
Leave it just to me
Saving forever for you baby
You are the only one
I'd ever give forever to.
Love for a lifetime won't do baby
Want to always stay together
So I'm saving forever for you.
Forever I'll be loving you
I'll be there as long as time passes by
All through it all
I'll be standing by you.
Looking in your eyes
Tomorrow's all I see
Long as there's forever, baby
I will always be.
Needing you here with me
Saving forever for you, baby
You are the only one
I'd ever give forever to.
Love for a lifetime won't do.baby
Want to always stay together
So I'm saving forever for you
