A, yeah yeah
You've got to show me love
Heart breaks and promises
I've had more than my share
I'm tired of giving my love
And gettin' nowhere (nowhere)
What I need is somebody
Who really cares
I really need a lover
A lover that wants to be there
Its been so long since I've touched a wanting hand
I cant put my love on the line
This I hope you'll understand
So baby if u want me
You've got to show me love
Words aren't so easy to say oh I
You've got to show me love
I'm tired of getting caught up
In those one night affairs
What I really need is somebody
Who will always be there
Don't you promise me the world
All that I've already heard
This time around for me baby
Actions speak louder than words
If your looking for devotion
Talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Because my love is guaranteed
So baby if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words aren't so easy to say oh I
You've got to show me love
Show me show me baby
You've got to give it to me give it to me give it to me yeah
I don't want no fakes don't want no foney
I need your love
Show me show me show me baby
Give it to me give it to me
I am not a toy I'm not a play thing
You've got to understand
If you're looking for devotion
Talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Because my love is guaranteed
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
