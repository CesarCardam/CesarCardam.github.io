72. Jon SecadaOtro Dia Mas Sin Verte
I, I can't read the future
But I still want to hold you close
Right now, I need that from you
So give me the morning
Sharing another day
With you, is all I want to know
And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes still shines
You shine like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go
No, I, I didn't want to tell you
Things I didn't want to know myself
I was afraid to show
But you, you gave me a reason
A reason to face the truth
Oh yes you did
To face the truth, face the truth, face the truth
And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes still shines, shines
You shines like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go
Won't let me go
Let go of my heart
And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes still shines
Like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go
I know
Won't let me go
