07. ShaiIf I Ever Fall in Love
The very first time
That I saw your brown eyes
Your lips said hello and I said hi
I knew right then you were the one
But I was caught up
In physical attraction
But to my satisfaction
Baby you were more than just a face
And if I ever (ever fall) in love again (again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever (ever fall) in love so true (true)
I will be sure that the lady's just like you
Oh, yeah, the very next time she'll be my friend
If I say that I will be your one and only
(promise, promise) Promise that you'll never leave me lonely
I just wanna be the one you need
Oh, baby
I just wanna be the one who serves you
Sometime I feel as if I don't deserve you
I cherish every moment that we share
*chorus*
Very next time she will be my friend
Someone who I can believe in
(my friend)
I need someone who'll be my friend
(my friend)
To be with me through thick and thin
(my friend)
Please share my love with me my friend
I need someone like you
