23. Exposealbum
I hear you're taking the town again
Havin' a good time with all your good-time friends
I don't think that you think of me
You're on your own now, and I'm alone and free
I know that I should get on with my life
But a life lived without you could never be right
[Chorus]
As long as the stars shine down from the heavens,
Long as the rivers run to the sea,
I'll never get over you getting over me
I try to smile so the hurt won't show
Tellin' everybody I was glad to see you go
But the tears just won't go away (won't go away)
Loneliness found me, looks like it's here to stay
I know that I oughta find someone new
But all I find is myself always thinking of you
[Chorus]
Oh, no matter what I do,
Each night's a lifetime to live through
I can't go on like this
I need your touch
You're the only one I've ever loved
Oh oh ah
And as long as the stars shine down from the heavens,
Long as the rivers run to the sea,
I'll never get over you getting over me
(I'll never get over you getting over)
Never get over you getting over
I'll never get over you getting over me
