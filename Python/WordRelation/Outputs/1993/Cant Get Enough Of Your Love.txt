99. Taylor Daynealbum
I've heard people say that
Too much of anything
Is not good for you baby
But I don't know about that
As many times as we've loved
Shared love and made love
It doesn't seem to me
Like it's ever, ever enough
It's just not enough
[Chorus]
My darling, I , can't get enough of your love babe
I don't know I don't know I don't know why
I can't get enough of your love babe
Oh some things I can't get used to
No matter how I try
It's like the more you give the more I want
And baby that's no lie, oh no babe
Tell me what can I say
What am I gonna do
How should I feel, when everything is you you you
What kind of love is this
That you've given me
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet
All I know is every time you're near
I feel a change
Something's moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing
[Chorus]
If I could make you see
And make you understand
Your love for me is all I need
and more than I can stand
Oh well babe
How can I explain
All the things I feel
You've given me so much
You're so unreal, unreal, unreal
Still I keep loving you
More and more each time
What am I gonna do
Cause you've blown my mind
I get the same old feeling
Every time you're near
I feel a change
Something's moving
I scream your name
What you got me doing
[Chorus]
