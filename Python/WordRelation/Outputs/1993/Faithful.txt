89. Go WestLive
Don't cry baby, kiss me and say farewell
Nothing's going to break the spell.
And if you're thinking time will tell
I want you to know.
Every minute of every single day,
even when I'm miles away.
I'll keep the promises I made.
I want you to know
I will be faithful to my lover's prayer.
Faithful and I don't care
if the world around us gives up on love,
I will make you see you can count one me.
I will be faithful, faithful to my lover's prayer,
to my lover's prayer.
Listen baby, you can lean on me,
though we sail on stormy seas.
Nothing good comes easily,
and I won't let you down.
I will be faithful to my lover's prayer.
Faithful and I don't care
if the world around us gives up on love,
I will make you see you can count one me.
I will be faithful, faithful to my lover's prayer,
to my lover's prayer.
Baby, you can lean on me,
you can lean on me.
Baby, you can lean on me,
you can lean on me.
Baby, you can lean on me,
you can lean on me.
Baby, you can lean on me,
you can lean on me.
Trust me baby, this is not goodbye.
There's no need for you to cry.
What we've got's too strong to be denied, Yeah.
I will be faithful to my lover's prayer.
Faithful and I don't care.
If the world around us gives up on love,
I will make you see you can count on me.
I will be faithful to my lovers prayer.
Faithful to the dream we share.
If the world around us gives up on love,
I will make you see you can count on me.
I will be faithful to my lovers prayer.
Oo, faithful. Faithful,
faithful to the dream we share.
Oo, faithful.
Faithful, faithful.
Oo, faithful.
Oo, faithful. Faithful,
faithful to the dream we share.
Oo, faithful.
Faithful, faithful.
