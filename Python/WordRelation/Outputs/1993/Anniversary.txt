Tomorrow will come and girl
I can't wait it's our anniversary (echo) anniversary
The first thing I'll do is run straight to you it our anniversary (echo) anniversary
[Chorus]
It's our anniversary (echo)
It's our anniversary, anniversary
It's our anniversary (echo)
It's our anniversary, made for you and me
And I've only made plans to hold your little hand
It's our anniversary (echo) anniversary
The pleasure's all mine 'cause we have seen good times
It's our anniversary Victoria
Won't be no secret at the end of the day
It's our anniversary
(echo) anniversary
A small cup of tea to you and me it's our anniversary
All I really want to say my darling today is a special day we call our
Own so take me in your arms and hold me and tell me you love me
And I'll be there for you
Do you know what today is
Do you know what today is
It's our anniversary (it's our, it's our special day)
Anniversary
Do you know what today is
It's our anniversary made for you and me
Today is a special day not just any day cause you can have everything
You want your way
Tell your supervisor you're leaving early today and
I'm going to pay for the rest of your day
Do you know what today is it's our anniversary, anniversary
Do you know what today is it's our anniversary, anniversary
Today I have lots of fun stuff for you girl
Do you know what today is it's our anniversary
Do you know what today is it's our anniversary, made for you and me
I know girl
I know
It's our anniversary.
And I love you in a special way
I remember the first night
I remember the first day
Do you know what today is it's our anniversary (till fade)
