I tremble inside just thinking
About the world around us
Scared, can't help to wonder
(Don't want any changes) about the way we feel
Do you know what I mean? Ohh
Catch me, I'm falling
Say it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
I know that we belong
Do you believe in us?
I'll give you all I can
Yes our love will still be strong
Girl, I believe in us (girl I beleive in us)
I'll give you all I can oh oh oh
Time has redefined the meaning of love, the way we know it
Love, the way we show it
(I don't want any changes) when it comes to you
I like us the way it is
(No matter what happens)
Say it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
(I know) I know that we belong
Do you believe in us?
Just give me another chance
Yes, our love still be strong
Girl I believe in us?
I'll give you all I can
I don't want any changes (unless you want them too)
Forever ain't long enough, baby (nothing can change us)
Say it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
(I know) I know that we belong
Do you believe in us? (Yes I do)
Just give me another chance
Yes our love will still be strong
Girl, I believe in us (girl I beleive in us)
I'll give you all I can (ooh oh oh)
I know that we belong
Do you believe in us? (Do you beleive?)
Just give me another chance
Yes our love will still be strong
Girl, I believe in us (girl I beleive in us)
I'll give you all I can
I know that we belong
Do you believe in us? (Do you believe in us?)
Just give me another chance
Yes our love will still be strong
Girl, I believe in us (girl I beleive in us)
I'll give you all I can
