Me sitting 'round cool with my dibbie-dibbie girl
Police knock my door, lick up my pal
Rough me up and I can't do a thing
Pick up my line when my telephone ring
Take me to the station black up my hands
Trail me down cause I'm hanging with the Snowman
What I'm gonna do? I'm backed and I'm trapped
Slap me in the face and took all of my gap
They have no clues and they wanna get warmer
But Shan won't turn informer
Informer, you no say "daddy, me Snow, me I'll go blame"
A licky boom-boom down
Detective-mon said daddy me Snow me stab someone down the lane
