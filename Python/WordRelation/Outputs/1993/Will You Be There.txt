47. Michael JacksonThe Essential Michael Jackson
Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?
When weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me
(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)
(Hold me)
(Love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me)
(I will feel blessed)
(Carry)
(Carry me boldly)
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me there)
(Save me)
(Heal me and bathe me)
(Softly you say to me)
(I will be there)
(Lift me)
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me boldly)
(Show me you care)
(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)
(Need me)
(Love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me)
(I will feel blessed)
