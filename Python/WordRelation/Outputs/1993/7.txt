52. Prince & The New Power GenerationThe Hits 1
All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savior-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through all
Space and time, so don't cry
One day all seven will die
All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through all
Space and time, so don't cry
One day all seven will die
And I saw an angel come down unto me
In her hand she holds the very key
Words of compassion, words of peace
And in the distance an army's marching feet (one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four)
But behold, we will watch them fall
And we lay down on the sand of the sea
And before us animosity will stand and decree
That we speak not of love only blasphemy
And in the distance, six others will curse me
But that's alright (that's alright)
For I will watch them fall (one, two, three, four, five, six, seven)
All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through all
Space and time, so don't cry
One day all seven will die
(Just how old)
And we will see a plague and a river of blood
And every evil soul will surely die in spite of
And seven tears, but do not fear
Four in the distance, twelve souls from now
You and me will still be here we will still be here
There will be a new city with streets of gold
The young so educated they never grow old
And a, there will be no death four with every breath
A voice of many colors sings a song
That's so bold
Sing it while we watch them fall
All seven and we'll watch them fall
They stand in the way of love
And we will smoke them all
With an intellect and a savoir-faire
No one in the whole universe
Will ever compare
I am yours now and you are mine
And together we'll love through all
Space and time, so don't cry
One day all seven will die
(Just how old)
