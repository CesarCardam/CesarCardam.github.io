79. Captain Hollywood Projectalbum
[Chorus]
More and more and more, I don't know where we're going to
More and more and more, there's so much we don't want to do
'Cause we lie, we cheat and we learn from each and every heart affair
Yes, we lie, we cheat and we hurt till somebody's in despair
Boom, keep in tune,
Hollywood will soon left the point,
Right to the point smokin'
Like it's a joint, makin'
Ain't got time to be fakin'
It's my turn and I'm takin'
Everything without shakin'
Yo here with the bacon
[Chorus]
More and more and more
More and more and more
More and more bam, don't give a damn
Pump the music and jam there's no time for the problem
Not a thought to some, but just make sure you get it
Show the fella's you with it
Be impromptu get it, never will you forget it
[Chorus]
More and more and more
More and more and more
