There's a pale moon in the sky
The kind you make your wishes on
Like the light in your eyes
The one I built my dreams upon
It's not there any longer
Something happened somewhere
And we both know why
But me, I'm getting stronger
We must stop pretending
I can't live this life
I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really want to fight no more (Too much talking babe)
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really want to fight no more (This is time for letting go)
I hear a whisper in the air
It simply doesn't bother me
Can't you see that I don't care
Or are you you looking right through me
Seems to me that lately
You look at me the wrong way and I start to cry
Could it be that maybe
This crazy situation is the reason why
I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't reaaly want to fight no more (Too much talking babe)
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really want to fight no more (Tired of all these games)
But baby don't you know
That I don't want to hurt no more (It's time, I'm walking babe)
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really want to fight no more (This is time for letting go)
Hanging on to the past
It only stands in our way
We had to grow for our love to last
But we just grew apart
No, I don't want to hurt no more
But baby don't you know
No I don't want to hurt no more (Too much talking babe)
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really want to fight no more (Tired of all these games)
I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really want to fight no more (It's time, I'm walking babe)
So let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really want to fight no more (This is time for letting go)
