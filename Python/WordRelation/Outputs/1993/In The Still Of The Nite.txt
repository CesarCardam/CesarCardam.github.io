12. Boyz II Menalbum
In the still of the night
I held you, held you tight
Oh I love, love you so
Promise I'll never let ya go
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
I remember (I remember) that night in bed
Well the stars (the stars) were bright above
I hope and I pray
To keep your precious love
So before the light
Hold me again
With all of your might
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
So before the light
Hold me again with all of your might
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
