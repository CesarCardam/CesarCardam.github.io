13. JadeJade To The Max
I got all this love, waiting just for you
I just got to know, that your love is true
Can't keep running boy, in and out my life
Want to be your girl, not cause the mood is right
If I let you come inside
Tomorrow will you hide?
Will you be there for me?
When I need someone to hold
Baby don't misunderstand
I do want you for my man
I just need a little time
Before I invest my love
Don't walk away boy
My love won't hurt you
Don't walk away boy
I'll be right there for you
You say all the things
That I like to hear
You push all my buttons baby
Love to have you close to me
Want to feel your love
Want to be for sure
That's it's me you need baby
Each and every night
If I let you come inside
Tomorrow will you hide?
Will you be there for me?
When I need someone to hold
Baby don't misunderstand
I do want you for my man
I just need a little time
Before I invest my love
Don't walk away boy
My love won't hurt you
Don't walk away boy
I'll be right there for you
Baby don't misunderstand
I want you for my man
I need a little time
Before I give you my love
Don't walk away boy
I'll be right there for you
Don't, do, don't, do, do, do don't
Don't walk away
This is what sounds like my love
Don't walk away boy
Don't walk away boy
I'll be right there for you
Don't walk away
Don't walk away boy
My love won't hurt you
Don't walk away boy
I'll be right there for you
Don't walk away boy
My love won't hurt you
