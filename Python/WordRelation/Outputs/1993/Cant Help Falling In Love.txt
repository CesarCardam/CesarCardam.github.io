Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay
Would it be a sin?
But I can't help falling in love with you
As the river flows
gently to the sea
Darling, so we go
Some things were meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
But I can't help falling in love with you
As the river flows
gently to the sea
Darling so we go
Some things were meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
But I can't help falling in love with you
I can't help falling in love with you
I can't help falling in love with you
I can't help falling in love with you
