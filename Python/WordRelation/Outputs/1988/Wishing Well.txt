12. Terence Trent d'ArbyIntroducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D&#039;Arby
Kissing like a bandit stealing time underneath a sycamore tree.
Cupid by the hour sends Valentines to my sweet lover and me.
Slowly, but surely your appetite is more than I knew.
Sweetly, softly I'm falling in love with you.
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell;
a wishing well of butterfly tears.
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell.
A wishing well of crocodile tears sing.
Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do right beside a riverboat gambler.
Erotic images float through my head; I wanna be your midnight rambler.
Quickly, but quickly the blood races through me veins.
Quickly, loudly I wanna hear those sugar bells ring.
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell;
a wishing well of butterfly tears.
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell.
