55. Jody WatleyThe Best Of Jody Watley
When I first laid my eyes upon you
I knew right then and there you were the one
Eyes so deep, you send me melting
And then you smiled as if to say, "Oh, yeah"
But then you seemed to change your mind
You looked away like you were, oh, so shy
Is the game you're playing hard to get
Won't you tell me, oh, ho
Want me, want me like I want you
To touch you and to hold you tight
Don't you want me like I want you
To kiss and love all through the night
I'd like to know more than just your name
Did you come here alone or with someone
If only you would open up
And let me know just where you're comin' from
Are you lookin' for a new love
Or does commitment seem to bring you down
Is that a look of yes or is it no
Please don't tease me, ho...oh...
Want me, don't you want me
To touch you and to hold you tight
Don't you want me like I want you
To kiss and love all through the night
Oh, whoa, yeah
Don't you want
Oh, whoa, yeah
Don't you want
Want me, don't you want me
To touch you and to hold you tight
Don't you want me like I want you
To kiss and love all through the night
Are you lookin' for a new love
Or does commitment seem to bring you down
Is that a look of yes or is it no
Please don't tease me, oh...oh...
Want me, don't you want me
To touch you and to hold you tight
Don't you want me like I want you
To kiss and love all through the night
Want me, don't you want me
To touch you and to hold you tight
Don't you want me like I want you
To kiss and love all through the night
Want me (Oh, oh), don't you want me (Yeah)
(Don't you want me)
Want me (Oh, oh), don't you want me (Yeah, yeah)
(Don't you want me)
