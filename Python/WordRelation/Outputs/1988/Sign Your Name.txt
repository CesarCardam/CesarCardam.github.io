58. Terence Trent d'ArbyIntroducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D&#039;Arby
Fortunately you have got
Someone who relies on you
We started out as friends
But the thought of you just caves me in
the symptoms are so deep
It is much too late to turn away
We started out as friends
Sign you name
Across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name
Across my heart
I want you to be my lady
Time I'm sure will bring
Disappointments in so many things
It seems to be the way
When your gambling cards on love you play
I'd rather be in hell with you baby
Than in cool heaven
It seems to be the way
Sign your name
Across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name
Across my heart
I want you to be my lady
Birds never look into the sun
Before the day is done
But oh the light shines brighter
On a peaceful day
Stranger blue leave us alone
We don't want to deal with you
We'll shed our stains showering
In the room that makes the rain
All alone with you
Makes the butterflies in me arise
Slowly we make love
And the earth rotates
To our dictates
Slowly we make love
Sign your name
Across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name
