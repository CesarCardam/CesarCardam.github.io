37. Bobby McFerrinalbum
Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note-for-note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double
Don't worry, be happy Don't worry, be happy now
Ooo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo hoo-hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry
Woo-oo-woo-oo-woo-oo-ooo Be happy
Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry, be happy
Ooo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo hoo-hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry
Woo-oo-woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Be happy
Woo-oo-woo-oo-ooo Don't worry, be happy
Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, (ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha) be happy (look at me, I'm happy)
Ooo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Be happy
Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo (Here, I'll give you my phone number. When you're
Worried, call me. I'll make you happy.)
Ooo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo Be happy
Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you're worried, your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy Don't worry, be happy now
Ooo-oo-hoo-oo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Be happy
Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry, be happy
Ooo-oo-oo-oo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo Be happy
Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry, be happy
Now there, is this song I wrote
I hope you learned it note-for-note, like good little children
Don't worry, be happy
A-listen to a-what I say
In your life, expect some trouble
When you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy, be happy now
Ooo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Be happy
Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry, be happy
Ooo-oo-hoo-oo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Be happy
Woo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry, be happy
Ooo-oo-hoo-oo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry, don't worry
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't do it, be happy
Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Put a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like
This
Ooo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry
Ooo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo It will soon pass, whatever it
Is
Ooo-oo-oo-oo-ooo Don't worry, be happy
Ooo-oo-hoo-hoo-oo oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo I'm not worried
Ooo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo I'm happy
Ooo-oo-oo-oo-ooo
