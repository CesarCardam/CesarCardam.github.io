If a boy had a chance
A chance with someone like you
Are you gonna break his heart?
Let him cry for the moon?
Are you hiding somewhere behind those eyes?
I just freeze
Every time you see through me
And it's all over you
Electric blue
On my knees
Help me, baby
Tell me, what can I do?
Electric blue
Oh, I had a dream
For a moment I believed it was true
Oh, I'd have given anything
Just to be there with you
Are you hiding
Somewhere behind those eyes?
I just freeze
Every time you see through me
And it's all over you
Electric blue
In too deep
Standing here waiting
As I'm breaking into
Electric blue
I can see
Can see that it may be just a vision for you
Electric blue
On my knees
Help me, baby
Tell me what can I do?
Electric blue
