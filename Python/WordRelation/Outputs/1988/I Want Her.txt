She's so bad, in my eyes
I seen ya last night
I saw you standing there
Couldn't picture the color of your hair
And all I wanted to know
Were you really there
I want to know was it my imagination
Ooh you know it was a sweet sensation
Lookin' at you from a distance
It seemed so real
You and I together
Dream it seemed for real
If its a dream please don't wake me up
It feels so real
All I know is
I want her

You turn me on and on
This feelin' girl is so strong
My heart girl is on fire

And I've got a thing for you
Dreams of you and me baby
