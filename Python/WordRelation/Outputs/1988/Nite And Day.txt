87. Al B. Sure!album
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day
How I feel about you
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day
How I feel about you
I'll love you more in the rain or shine
And making love in the rain is fine
A love so good and I call it mine
Love is blind
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day
How I feel about you
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day
How I feel about you
Believe me when I say that I do care, I can tell you
I'd like to run my fingers through your hair, I can tell you
Baby, if you left I could not bear, I can tell you
Please don't share
Do you love me, please let me know (I can tell you)
Don't hide the feeling, just let it show (I can tell you)
A feeling so deep that comes within (I can tell you)
What kind of love am I in, ooh
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day
How I feel about you
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day
How I feel about you
If you and I were one, girl
The love would share would be so fun
Just take my hand and you'll see, girl
That we'd take off into another world
I can tell you how I feel about you (oh) night and day (uh-huh)
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh)
I can tell you how I feel (woo) about you night and day
(I'll love you more in the rain or shine)
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day
(Night and day, night and day, night and day)
I can tell you how I feel (woo) about you night and day
(Making love in the rain is fine)
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day
I can tell you how I feel about you night and day
