I want to know
What you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I want to know
What you're feeling
Tell me what's on you mind
Here i am in silence,
Looking round without a clue
I find myself along again
All alone with you
I can see behind your eyes,
The things that i don't know
If you hide away from me,
How can our love grow?
I want to know
What you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I want to know
What you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind
I know i could break you down,
But what good would it do?
I could surely never know
That what you say is true
Here i am in silence,
It's a game i have to play
You and i in silence
With nothing else to say
I want to know
What you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I want to know
What you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind
I want to know
What you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I want to know
What you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind
I want to know
What you're thinking
There are some things you can't hide
I want to know
What you're feeling
Tell me what's on your mind
