54. Debbie Gibsonalbum
Without you, without you
I always thought that everything was fine without you
Never knowing you'd be mine
Suddenly my world has changed
And I just wonder why
All it took was just one smile
[Chorus:]
Now with you, out of the blue
Love appeared before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought I'd realize what love was
what love was, what love was
I need you, oh I need you
And everyday I love you more and more
Without you (dreams and tears)
I know what it's all for
Suddenly I see you there
And everything's ok
Don't know why I feel this way
[Chorus]
Here with you
We are together now
Never take my heart away
All the love I found
Is here to stay (Out of the blue)
It's like a dream come true
I never thought I'd fall in love with you
Out of the blue
Love appeared before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought
Here with you
Out of the, out of the, out of the clear blue
Oh, it's like a dream come true,
I never thought, I never thought
Out of the blue
Before my eyes with you
A dream come true
I never thought I'd fall in love with you
Out of the, out of the, out of the, out of the clear blue
