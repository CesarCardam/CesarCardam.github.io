Yeah,
Lover I'm off the streets
Gonna go where the bright lights
And the big city meet
With a red guitar, on fire
Desire
She's the candle
Burning in my room
I'm like the needle
Needle and spoon
Over the counter
With a shotgun
Pretty soon, everybody got one
And the fever when I'm beside her
Desire,
Desire
Desire
Desire
Burning
Burning
