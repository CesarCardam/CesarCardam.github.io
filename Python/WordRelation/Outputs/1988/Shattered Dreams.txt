26. Johnny Hates Jazzalbum
So much for your promises
They died the day you let me go
Caught up in a web of lies
But it was just too late to know
I thought it was you
Who would stand by my side
And now you've given me given me
Nothing but shattered dreams shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away run away
From this empty heart
You said you'd die for me,
Woke up to reality
And found the future not so bright
I dreamt the impossible
That maybe things could work out right
I thought it was you
Who would do me no wrong
But now
From this empty heart
I thought it was you who said they'd die for love
