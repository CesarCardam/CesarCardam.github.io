Wait, wait
I never had a chance to love you
Now I only want to say I love you one more time
Wait, just a moment before our love will die
'Cause I must know the reason why we say goodbye
Wait, just a moment and tell me why
'Cause I can show you lovin' that you won't deny
I said wait, and show your lovin' like it was before
'Cause I won't let that feelin' walk out through the door
I said wait, just a moment and try once more
'Cause babe, I need to hold you like I did before
So if you go away, I know that I will follow
'Cause there's a place inside my heart that tells me
Hold out, hold out, hold out, oh baby
Wait, wait
I never had a chance to love you
Wait, wait
If only our love could show you
Wait, wait
I never want to be without you
Wait, wait
No, I never had a chance to love you
Now I only want to say I love you one more time
So if you go away, I know that I will follow
'Cause there's a place inside my heart that tells me
Hold out, hold out, hold out, oh baby
Wait, wait
I never had a chance to love you
Wait, wait
If only our love could show you
Wait, wait
I never want to be without you
Wait, wait
No, I never had a chance to love you
Now I only want to say I love you
Baby, I'm begging you, baby
No, I never had a chance to love you
