82. Van HalenLive: Right Here, Right Now
Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Somethin' to fill in the holes
We think a lot but don't talk much about it
'Til things get out of control
Oh, how do I know when it's love
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
How does it feel when it's love
It's just something you feel together
When it's love
You look at every face in a crowd
Some shine and some keep you guessin'
Waiting for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson
How do I know when it's love
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
How does it feel when it's love
It's just something you feel together
Oh oh oh oh
Oh when it's love
Oh oh oh oh
You can feel it yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Nothing's missing, yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah, you can feel it
Oh oh oh oh
Oh when it's love
Oh oh oh oh
Nothing's missing
How do I know when it's love
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
Uh, how does it feel when it's love
It's just something you feel together
Hey, how do I know when it's love
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
When it's love
Uh, when it's love
Hey it lasts forever
(Na, na, na, na, na) when it's love
(Na, na, na, na, na)
(Na, na, na, na, na)
(Na, na, na, na, na) give it up
We're gonna feel this thing together (na, na, na, na, na)
When it's love, oh (na, na, na, na, na)
When it's love, baby (na, na, na, na, na)
(Na, na, na, na, na)
You can feel it, yeah
(Na, na, na, na, na)
(Na, na, na, na, na)
We'll make it last forever
(Na, na, na, na, na)
(Na, na, na, na, na)
Oh, it's love
