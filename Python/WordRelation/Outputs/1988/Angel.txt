34. AerosmithA Little South Of Sanity (Live)
I'm alone, yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears and the cryin' that I do is for you
I want your love
Let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough
I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough
I've suffered and I've seen the light
Bayayby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it alright
Don't know what I'm gonna do about this feeling inside
Yes it's true, loneliness took me for a ride
Without your love I'm nothing but a beggar
Without your love a dog without a bone
What can I do? I'm sleepin' in this bed alone
Bayayby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it alright
