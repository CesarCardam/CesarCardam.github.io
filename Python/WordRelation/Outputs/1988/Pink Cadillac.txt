75. Natalie ColeEverlasting
You may think I'm fooling
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do
Well baby, you know you bug me
There ain't no secret about that
Well come on over here and hug me
And, baby, I'll spill the facts
Well, honey it ain't your money
'Cause baby I got plenty of that
I love you for your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there in back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Well now way back in the bible, temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting you
Into doing something they know is wrong
Well they tempt you man with silver and they tempt you sir with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures that the flesh does surely hold
They say eve tempted Adam with an apple
Man I ain't going for that
I know it was her pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there in back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac, yeah
Now some folks say it's too big and uses too much gas
Some folks say that it's too old and that it goes too fast
But my love is bigger than a honda, it's bigger than a Subaru
Hey man there's only one thing and one car that will do
Anyway we don't have to drive it honey, we can park it out in back
And have a party in your
Pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there in back of your pink Cadillac
You know the one I mean
Le Car
