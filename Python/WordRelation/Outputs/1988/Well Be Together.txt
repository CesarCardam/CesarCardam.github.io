84. StingNothing Like The Sun
I see me with you, and all the things you do keep turning
Round and round in my mind.
Forget the weather, we should always be together.
Any other thought is unkind.
To have you with me, I would swim the seven seas
I need you as my guide and my light
My love is a flame that burns in your name
We'll be together, we'll be together tonight
We'll be together, We'll be together
We'll be together
Ah I see you with me, and all I want to be
Is dancing here with you in my arms
Forget the weather, we should always be together
I'll always be a slave to your charms
To have you with me, I would swim the seven seas
I need you as my guide and my light
My love is a flame that burns in your name
We'll be together, we'll be together tonight
We'll be together, We'll be together
We'll be together
Call me baby
You can call me anything you want
Call me baby Call me, call me Ow!
I see you with me and baby makes three
I see me with you and all the things we do
Forget the weather, we should always be together
I need you as my guide and my light
My love is a flame that burns in your name
We'll be together, we'll be together tonight
We'll be together,
Together, we'll be together
We'll be together
We'll be together tonight
Together, we'll be together tonight
Together, we'll be together tonight
Together, we'll be together tonight
Together, we'll be together tonight
Together, we'll be together tonight
Together, we'll be together tonight
Together, we'll be together tonight
