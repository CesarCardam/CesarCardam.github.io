Hey, lady, let me tell you why
I can't live my life without you (Oh, baby)
Every time I see you walkin' by, I get a thrill
You don't understand, but in time you will
I must make you understand
I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
I want to be your man (Yes, I do, baby)
I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
Better not pass me by
'Cause if you do you'll lose a good thing (Oh, baby)
'Cause what I've got to say
Is sealed with a kiss and a wedding ring (Wedding ring)
My mind is blind, at times I can't see anyone but you
Those other girls don't matter, no, they can't spoil my view
I must make you understand
I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
I want to be your man (Yes, I do, baby)
I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
Words can never say what I feel
It's too intense
I tried, I tired, I tried, I tried to tell you how I feel
But I get mixed up (So mixed up)
My mind is blind, at times I can't see anyone but you
Those other girls don't matter, no, they can't spoil my view
I must make you understand
I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
I want to be your man (Yes, I do, baby)
I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
I want to be your man (Yes, I do)
I want to be your man
I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
I want to be your man (Yes, I do, baby)
I want to be your man (I want to be your man)
