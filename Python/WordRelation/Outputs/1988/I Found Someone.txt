94. CherThe Very Best Of Cher
Don't you know, so many things they come and go
Like your words that once rang true
Just like the love I thought I found in you
And I remember the thunder, talkin' 'bout the fire in your eyes
But you walked away when I needed you most
Now maybe, baby, maybe, baby, I found someone
To take away the heartache, to take away the loneliness
I've been feelin' since you've been gone, since you've been gone
Dry your eyes. I never could bear to see you cry
Someday your love will shine through
And show you the feelings you never really knew
But, baby, don't ya lose that thunder, talkin' 'bout the fire in your eyes
You're lookin' at me but you still don't believe
That maybe, baby, maybe, baby, I found someone
To take away the heartache, to take away the loneliness
I've been feelin' since you've been gone, since you've been gone
