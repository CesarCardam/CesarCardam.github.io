I don't love her
I tried to tell myself
But you can see it in my eyes
So don't deny
I can't fool no one else
The truth is in the tears I cry cause
If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside
Of it isn't love
I told her I'd never fall in love (rap)
But now I know better
How does it feel
I can't describe this feelin'
That came when I saw her last night
She got to me
I'll let you know the reason
I saw her with another guy so
If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside
Of it isn't love
Maybe she'll take me back
Hey girl he's begging
I made a big mistake
Won't you forgive him girl
Now I can feel it
He's never felt before
I really love her
You love her, what?
It took my heart
To shatter in a thousand pieces
Before I'd ever drop my pride
Losing love worrying about my image
Really helped me realize that
If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside
Of it isn't love
