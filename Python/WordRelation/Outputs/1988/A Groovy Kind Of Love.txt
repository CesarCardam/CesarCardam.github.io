29. Phil CollinsLove Songs: A Compilation Old &amp; New
When I'm feelin' blue
All I have to do is take a look at you
Then I'm not so blue
When you're close to me
I can feel you heart beat
I can hear you breathing in my ear
Wouldn't you agree
Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love
Any time you want to
You can turn me on to
Anything you want to
Any time at all
When I kiss your lips
Oh, I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside
Wouldn't you agree
Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love
When I'm feelin' blue
All I have to do is take a look at you
Then I'm not so blue
When I'm in your arms
Nothing seems to matter
My whole world could shatter, I don't care
Wouldn't you agree
Baby, you and me got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love, oh wow
We got a groovy kind of love
