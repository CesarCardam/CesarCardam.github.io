32. Debbie Gibsonalbum
Ooh
There was a time when
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Were over
There was a place where
All you could do was
Wish on a four-leaf clover
But now is a new time
There is a new place
Where dreams just can't come true
It started the day when I left you (oh)
I could never love again the way that I loved you (oh)
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh, the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart (without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart
When I was sorry
It was too late to turn around (turn around)
And tell you so
There was no reason
There was no reason
Just a foolish beat of my heart
I could never love again the way that I loved you (oh)
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh, the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart (without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart
Oh, can't you see I'm not fooling nobody?
Don't you see the tears are falling down my face?
Since you went away
Break my heart, you slipped away
Didn't know I was wrong
Never meant to hurt you now you're gone
Ooh
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Ooh
Ooh
I could never love again now that we're apart
(Now that we're apart) oh
I could never love again now that we're apart
