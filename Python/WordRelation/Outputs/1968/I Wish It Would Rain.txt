Hmm hmm
Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
A girl has found another and gone away
With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room
I know to you, it might sound strange
But I wish it would rain, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause so badly I wanna go outside (such a lovely day)
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain, oh yeah
People this hurt I feel inside
Words could never explain,
I just wish it would rain, oh let it rain, rain, rain, rain, ooo baby
Let it rain, oh yeah, let it rain
Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pane
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain
'Cause rain drops will hide my tear drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying
Crying when I go outside
To the world outside my tears
I refuse to explain, ooo I wish it would rain, ooh, baby
Let it rain, let it rain
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
Oh, let it rain
Oh yeah, yeah, listen
I'm a man and I got my pride
'Til it rains I'm gonna stay inside, let it rain
