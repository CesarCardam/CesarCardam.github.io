90. James Brown & The Famous Flamesalbum
Now we demand a chance to do things for ourserlf
We're tired of beatin' our head against the wall
And workin' for someone else
We're people, we're just like the birds and the bees
We'd rather die on our feet
Than be livin' on our knees
Say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud
