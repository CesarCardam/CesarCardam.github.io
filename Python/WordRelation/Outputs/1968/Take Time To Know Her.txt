54. Percy SledgeThe Ultimate Performance: When a Man Loves a Woman
I found a woman
I felt a true love
She was everything
I'd ever been dreaming of
But she was bad, I didn't know it
Her pretty smile never did show it
All I knew is what I could see
And I knew I wanted her for me
Took her home to mama
Mama, wanna see my future bride
Well she looked at us both
Then she called me to her side
She said son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight thing
Take time to know her
Please don't go rushin to do your thing
But I didn't listen to my mama
I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait for that little girl of mine
When I got off from work
The preacher was there
So was my future bride
He looked at us both and he called me to his side
Take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing
But it looks like every thing's gonna turn out all right
But then I came home from work a little early one night
And there she was kissin on another man
Now I know what mama meant when she took me by the hand
She said, take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing
She said, take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing
Take time to know her
