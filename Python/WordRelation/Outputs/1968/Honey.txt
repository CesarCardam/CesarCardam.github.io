See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad,
The first day that she planted it
Was just a twig
Then the first snow came and she ran out
To brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited,
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart,
Kinda dumb and kinda smart
And I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago
And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from workin' late
'Cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there and cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show
