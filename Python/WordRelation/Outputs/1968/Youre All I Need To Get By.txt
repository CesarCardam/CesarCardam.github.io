82. Marvin Gaye & Tammi TerrellCollected
You're all I need to get by, oh, oh
You're all I need to get by, oh, oh
Like sweet morning dew, I took one look at you (you're all I need to get by)
And it was plain to see, you were my destiny (you're all I need to get by)
With my arms open wide (you're all I need to get by)
I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life for you, oh, oh
I will go where you lead, c'mon, baby, always there in time of need, oh, oh
And when I lose my will you'll be there to push me up the hill
There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure 'nough, that's enough
You're all, You're all I need to get by
(You're all I need to get by), oh, oh, yeah, yeah, tammi, listen
Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best (you're all I need to get by)
Stand by you like a tree, dare anybody to try and move me (you're all I need to get by)
Darling, in you I found (you're all I need to get by)
Strength where I was torn down (you're all I need to get by)
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door
Oh, baby, just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher
Oh, I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal
'Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination
You're all I want to strive for and do a little more
You're all, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one, you're
All, you're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need, oh, to get by (you're all I need to get by)
Ooh, baby, oh, baby (you're all I need to get by)
Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, yeah (you're all I need to get by)
I need you darlin' (you're all I need to get by)
Oh, I need you, all your love, you're all I need, oh (you're all I need to get by)
Oh, baby, you're all I need, I need your love, you're all I want
Oh, oh, all your love, now, yeah
