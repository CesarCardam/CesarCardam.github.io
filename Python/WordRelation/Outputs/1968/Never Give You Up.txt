100. Jerry ButlerThe Iceman Cometh/Ice on Ice
Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'
Girl, you treat me bad and I know why
Yeah, I've seen you runnin' around with another guy
And you think if you hurt me that I'll go away
Made it up in my mind that I'm here to stay
So tell 'em
Never gonna give you up
Whisper in his ear
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
You tell him that Jerry said he'll never let you go
So don't you think of leavin'
Hey, don't you understand
What you're doing to the man
Do you see these tears here inn my eyes
Ain't no use in my lyin'
Cause I really cried
You think you're gonna take me
And put me on the shelf
Girl, I'd rather die
Than see you with somebody else
So throw it out of your mind
I'll never leave you
Though you grieve me and deceive me, yeah
Hey, don't you understand
What you're doing to the man
My friends all say that I'm your fool
And you're using me like a carpenter uses a tool
And I know their intentions have all been good
Some of them would help me if they could
But I'll never give you up
Never, never, never, never let you go
No matter what you say
Don't you understand
That you're killing this man
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna give you up
No matter what you do to me, baby
