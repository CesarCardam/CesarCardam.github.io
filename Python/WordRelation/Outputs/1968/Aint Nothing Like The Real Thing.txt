57. Marvin Gaye & Tammi TerrellCollected
Ooh, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
No, no, ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Oh honey, I got your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame
Ooh, I read your letters when you're not near me
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear
Don'cha know, ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
I played my game, a fantasy
I pretend, but I know in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So, let's stay together
I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of your being there
Oh, so glad we got the real thing, baby
So glad we got the real thing
Oh, Marvin, so good, ain't nothing like the real thing, baby, so good
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Talk to me, ain't nothing like the real thing, baby, oh I'm so glad
Ain't nothing like the real thing
