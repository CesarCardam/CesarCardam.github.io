You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you, yeah
Girl, we couldn't get much higher
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
The time for hesitation is through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
Darling we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire, yeah
Yeah, you know that it would be untrue
And you know that I would be a liar
If I was to go and tell you
Momma we couldn't get much higher
Well, come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire, yeah
Yeah, come on baby light, would you light my fire, yeah
Come on baby light my fire, would you, oh it's alright
Light my fire, light my fire, light my fire
Light my fire, light my fire, light my fire, girl
You better light my fire
Come on baby, you better light, you better light my fire
