18. Hugh Masekelaalbum
Sure is mellow grazin' in the grass
(grazin' in the grass, yes, baby, can you dig it?)
What a trip just watchin' as the world goes past
(grazin' in the grass, yes, baby, can you dig it?)
There are too many groovy things to see while grazin' in the grass
(grazin' in the grass, yes, baby, can you dig it?)
Flowers with colours for takin', everything outta sight
(grazin' in the grass, yes, baby, can you dig it?)
The sun peekin' out between the leaves
(grazin' in the grass, yes, baby, can you dig it?)
And the bir-ir-ir-irds dartin' in and out of the trees
(grazin' in the grass, yes, baby, can you dig it?)
Everything here is so clear, you can see it
And everything here is so real, you can feel it
And it's real, so real, so real, so real, so real, so real
Can you dig it?
I can dig it, he can dig it, she can dig it,
we can dig it, they can dig it, you can dig it
Oh, let's dig it. Can you dig it, baby?
I can dig it, he can dig it, she can dig it,
we can dig it, they can dig it, you can dig it
Oh, let's dig it. Can you dig it, baby?
The sun peekin' out between the leaves
(grazin' in the grass, yes, baby, can you dig it?)
And the bir-ir-ir-irds dartin' in and out of the trees
(grazin' in the grass, yes, baby, can you dig it?)
Everything here is so clear, you can see it
And everything here is so real, you can feel it
And it's real, so real, so real, so real, so real, so real
Can you dig it?
I can dig it, he can dig it, she can dig it,
we can dig it, they can dig it, you can dig it
Oh, let's dig it. Can you dig it, baby?
I can dig it, he can dig it, she can dig it,
we can dig it, they can dig it, you can dig it
Oh, let's dig it. Can you dig it, baby?
